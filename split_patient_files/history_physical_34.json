We're  here  for  a  follow-up  regarding  my  son,  Jawad  Hussain.  Hes  7  years  old  and\n\nweighs  16  kg,  standing  at  105  cm.  He  is  from  Gujrat,  and  he  has  two  siblings,  one  of  whom  is\n\nhealthy. His birth was by C-section, and theres no known family history of any medical conditions.\n\nDoctor:\n\nAlright,  I  see.  Could  you  please  tell  me  more  about  his  condition  and  any  symptoms  hes  been\n\nexperiencing?\n\nPatient's Mother:\n\nYes, Jawad has been suffering from abdominal distension for the last six months. About six months\n\nago,  he  developed  this  distension  along  with  some  mild  pain.  We  initially  went  to  a  nearby  clinic,\n\nwhere  an  ultrasound  showed  hepatomegaly  and  altered  liver  echotexture.  He  was  referred  to\n\nChildrens Hospital, where they did some lab tests and performed an endoscopy. A liver biopsy was\n\nattempted but couldnt be completed due to bleeding concerns. Recently, I noticed two episodes of\n\nblood in his stool, about 2-3 ml of fresh blood after he passed stool, but it was painless, and there\n\nhasnt been any other bleeding elsewhere. He also had high-grade fever with variations throughout\n\nthe  day,  especially  at  night,  and  a  dry  cough.  The  symptoms  improved  after  we  started  some\n\nmedications prescribed by a local doctor.\n\n\fDoctor:\n\nThank you for explaining. I see that Jawads condition is quite serious. Do you have any history of\n\ncomplications or hospitalizations?\n\nPatient's Mother:\n\nYes, he was admitted to Childrens Hospital one month ago and three months ago as well. He has\n\nbeen  diagnosed  with  hepatic  fibrosis  based  on  an  ultrasound  performed  in  July  2023,  and  there\n\nhave been some decompensations like abdominal distension and mild pelvic ascites back in July.\n\nDoctor:\n\nUnderstood. Lets go ahead and check his current status. During the examination, I observed that his\n\nweight  and  height  are  below  the  25th  and  5th  percentiles,  respectively.  There  was  no  jaundice,\n\npallor,  or  edema.  His  liver  is  four  fingers  below  the  costal  margin,  and  its  firm  in  consistency.  The\n\nspleen is also palpable, about three fingers below the subcostal margin. His abdomen is distended,\n\nwith a prominent abdominal vein. I did not find any tenderness, but his liver and spleen could not be\n\nprecisely measured due to the tense abdomen.\n\nPatient's Mother:\n\nThats correct. He seems to be sleeping a lot lately and doesnt respond well to pain or stimuli. Hes\n\nnot very oriented either.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThank you for that. We will continue monitoring him closely. Ive gone through his recent lab results\n\nand previous tests. His bilirubin is at 1.10, ALT is 16, ALP is 432, albumin is 3.4, INR is 1.17, WBC\n\ncount  is  8.14,  hemoglobin  is  11.44,  and  platelets  are  244.  His  Hepatitis  B  surface  antigen  and\n\nanti-HCV tests were negative as of July 2023.\n\n\fPatient's Mother:\n\nYes, we had those tests done, and they came back negative.\n\nDoctor:\n\nGreat. As for the endoscopy, the last procedure on 27th July 2023 showed grade 2 varices with no\n\ngastroenteropathy,  and  one  band  was  applied.  The  follow-up  endoscopy  on  12th  October  2023\n\nshowed  grade  1  varices  with  moderate  to  severe  gastroenteropathy.  Based  on  the  ultrasound\n\nperformed on 15th July 2023, it was noted that his liver was enlarged, measuring 13 cm, with altered\n\nechogenicity. The spleen size was 9 cm. His diagnosis of congenital hepatic fibrosis is confirmed.\n\nPatient's Mother:\n\nYes, the doctors mentioned congenital hepatic fibrosis as the diagnosis.\n\nDoctor:\n\nFor  treatment,  were  currently  prescribing  the  following  medications:  Inderal  10  mg  twice  a  day,\n\nOss-Pro syrup 5 ml once daily, Cefspan DS syrup 5 ml once daily, A Dew drops two drops daily, and\n\nIndrop D once every 15 days. I have also advised a liver biopsy and shearwave elastography in the\n\nplan. Additionally, well continue surveillance endoscopy and follow-up after three months.\n\nPatient's Mother:\n\nThank  you,  doctor.  We  will  follow  the  plan  as  suggested.  Is  there  anything  else  we  should  be\n\nconcerned about?\n\nDoctor:\n\nCurrently,  the  focus  is  on  managing  his  symptoms,  preventing  further  complications  like  variceal\n\nbleeding,  and  closely  monitoring  liver  function.  Well  continue  to  adjust  his  treatment  based  on  his\n\n\fresponse. Please also be mindful of his diet and the medications. Lets plan for a follow-up visit in\n\nthree months. If his condition worsens before then, dont hesitate to contact us sooner.\n\nPatient's Mother:\n\nThank  you  so  much  for  your  care,  doctor.  Well  make  sure  to  follow  up  regularly  and  keep  you\n\nupdated.\n\nFollow-Up Visit on 26th February 2024\n\nDoctor:\n\nHello, how has Jawad been doing since we last saw him?\n\nPatient's Mother:\n\nHes  been  having  some  issues  with  black,  tarry  stools  again,  and  weve  noticed  that  his  abdominal\n\ndistention persists. He has also been sleeping a lot and is still quite irritable.\n\nDoctor:\n\nLets review his recent tests. His latest endoscopy on 10th February 2024 showed grade 1 varices\n\nwith  gastroenteropathy.  He  had  a  follow-up  ultrasound  on  17th  March  2024,  which  showed  mild\n\nhepatomegaly  with  homogeneous  texture.  His  liver  enzymes  are  still  elevated,  and  his  albumin\n\nlevels remain low.\n\nPatient's Mother:\n\nYes,  weve  been  following  the  treatment  regimen,  and  his  symptoms  have  been  somewhat\n\nmanageable, but theres still a lot of concern.\n\nDoctor:\n\n\fWell  continue  with  the  treatment  plan  as  advised.  Theres  no  change  in  his  medications:  Inderal,\n\nOss-Pro,  and  other  treatments.  I  would  also  recommend  that  you  follow  up  with  a  specialist  for\n\nfurther  optimization  of  his  medical  care.  Well  keep  a  close  eye  on  his  liver  function  and  general\n\nwell-being.\n\nPatient's Mother:\n\nUnderstood, doctor. Well keep following up as instructed. Thank you for your ongoing support.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYoure  welcome.  Keep  a  close  watch  on  his  condition  and  reach  out  if  you  notice  any  significant\n\nchanges. See you in three months for the next follow-up.\n\nFinal Follow-Up on 12th June 2024\n\nDoctor:\n\nHello, how is Jawad doing today?\n\nPatient's Mother:\n\nHes  been  struggling  with  his  symptoms,  but  weve  kept  up  with  his  medications.  Hes  been  having\n\nmore frequent black stools, and his distended abdomen has caused more discomfort.\n\nDoctor:\n\nBased on his latest examination and lab results, weve confirmed that his liver is still showing signs\n\nof significant strain. The next step is to consider liver transplantation. Well need to work closely with\n\nspecialists  for  counseling  and  further  evaluations.  Lets  continue  the  current  medications  and  keep\n\nmanaging his symptoms as best as we can.\n\n\fPatient's Mother:\n\nWere ready to take any necessary steps. Thank you for your continued care.\n\nDoctor:\n\nWell continue to support you and Jawad through this. Lets keep a strong line of communication and\n\naddress any issues that arise.\n\n\f",

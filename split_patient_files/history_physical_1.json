Bowel  sounds  are\n\naudible.\n\nDoctor: Your HCV PCR test from 1/8/24 is detected, confirming active HCV infection.\n\nDoctor: Your urinalysis on 11/07/24 showed glucose and blood. This might indicate diabetes.\n\nDoctor: We will start Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir (400/100 mg) for three months for HCV treatment.\n\nDoctor: Also, take Nuberol Forte for pain relief.\n\nDoctor: Follow up in six weeks.\n\nUrology OPD Follow-up (30/12/24)\n\nDoctor: How has your pain been?\n\nPatient:  I  have  been  experiencing  bilateral  flank  pain  for  the  past  year,  but  no  LUTS,  fever,  stone\n\npassage, nausea, or vomiting.\n\nDoctor: I see that you completed HCV treatment on 28/10/24.\n\nDoctor: A CT KUB scan from Faisalabad (done a year ago) showed bilateral partial staghorn calculi.\n\nDoctor: We need a fresh CT KUB and some blood tests (CBC, LFTs, PT/INR, APTT).\n\nDoctor: We will also consult gastroenterology and do a urine culture and sensitivity test.\n\nFollow-up Visit (Gastroenterology - 14/02/25)\n\n\fDoctor: How have you been?\n\nPatient: I completed my three-month Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir course for HCV.\n\nDoctor: Any active symptoms?\n\nPatient: No, I feel fine.\n\nDoctor: On examination, you have no jaundice or pallor.

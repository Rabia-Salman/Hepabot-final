I'm here for my follow-up.\n\nDoctor:\n\nGood morning. How have you been feeling lately? Any issues or changes since we last saw you?\n\nPatient:\n\nWell, I've been having some upper abdominal pain. It's been bothering me on and off. Also, Ive been\n\nfeeling a bit weak, and Ive noticed some weight loss recently.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI see. Lets review your past medical history. You were diagnosed with Hepatitis C about 10 years\n\nago,  correct?  You  were  treated  with  DAAs  for  six  months  and  achieved  a  sustained  virologic\n\nresponse. Your last PCR test was three years ago, and it came back negative.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, that's correct. Ive been stable with no major issues.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThats  good  to  hear.  Lets  look  at  your  recent  scans  and  labs.  Your  ultrasound  from  December  13,\n\n2022,  shows  a  slightly  cirrhotic  liver  with  multiple  hyperechoic  focal  lesions,  the  largest  measuring\n\n6.4 x 5.1 cm. Mild splenomegaly was noted, but there was no ascites.\n\n\fPatient:\n\nYes, I had that ultrasound done. What does it mean for me?\n\nDoctor:\n\nBased  on  the  CT  scan  from  December  21,  2022,  which  shows  a  slightly  coarse  liver  with  focal\n\nlesions  in  the  right  lobe,  theres  concern  for  a  possible  atypical  hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC)  or\n\nmetastatic  disease.  The  lesions  show  arterialization  and  relative  washout,  which  raises  concern.\n\nYou also have patent portal veins, which is a positive sign.\n\nPatient:\n\nThat sounds serious. Whats the next step?\n\nDoctor:\n\nYoure  right  to  be  concerned.  Well  proceed  with  a  treatment  plan  that  includes  transarterial\n\nchemoembolization  (TACE),  which  targets  the  tumors.  Youll  also  start  taking  Sorafenib,  an  oral\n\nmedication to help manage the HCC. Ive advised you to bring the CD of your CT scan and labs for\n\nfurther review.\n\nPatient:\n\nOkay, Ill bring those in. What about the treatment plan for Sorafenib?\n\nDoctor:\n\nYoull start with Sorafenib at 200 mg twice a day for 10 days, then well increase it to 400 mg twice a\n\nday if you tolerate it well. Also, well continue with Surbex Z once a day and Omeprazole 40 mg once\n\na day.\n\n\fPatient:\n\nGot it. Ill follow those instructions.\n\nPatient:\n\nI had my next visit on January 4, 2023, for a review. My AFP levels were still high at 37,839. The\n\ndoctors mentioned that my CT scan quality was poor, so theyve asked me to repeat it.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYes,  we  reviewed  the  scan  and  noted  the  poor  quality.  We  will  repeat  the  CT  scan  to  get  clearer\n\nimages.  As  for  the  treatment,  well  proceed  with  TACE  and  Sorafenib.  Also,  we  will  need  to  get  a\n\nbiopsy from the left liver lobe.\n\nPatient:\n\nOkay, Ill make sure to follow up on those.\n\nPatient:\n\nI was admitted in January for TACE and liver biopsy. The biopsy showed chronic hepatitis with mild\n\nsteatosis and focal portal fibrous expansion.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYes, Ive noted that. After the TACE procedure on January 28, 2023, you developed transaminitis,\n\nbut  your  liver  function  tests  are  improving.  You  had  fever  spikes,  but  those  seem  to  have  settled\n\nnow.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, I felt feverish for a while, but its better now.\n\n\fDoctor:\n\nGood.  Your  condition  is  stable.  Well  continue  with  your  medication,  including  Omeprazole,\n\nParacetamol,  and  Tramadol  for  pain  relief.  You  had  an  allergic  reaction  to  Tanzo,  so  we  switched\n\nyou to Ceftriaxone, which has been well-tolerated.\n\nPatient:\n\nI remember that. The medication switch helped a lot.\n\nDoctor:\n\nExcellent.  Youll  continue  with  Omeprazole,  Cefixime,  and  Lactulose  after  discharge.  I  also\n\nrecommend taking Nuberol for pain as needed.\n\nPatient:\n\nIll keep that in mind.\n\nDoctor:\n\nFollow-up is important. Well need to chase the liver biopsy report and get cultures. After two weeks,\n\nIll need fresh CBC and liver function tests. In four weeks, well reassess with baseline labs and an\n\nAFP test. A CT triphasic scan will also be done, and if the tumor remains, we may consider re-TACE\n\nor potential resection.\n\nPatient:\n\nUnderstood. Ill make sure to attend the follow-up and get the tests done.\n\nPatient:\n\nOn  March  14,  2023,  I  had  another  visit,  and  my  labs  showed  an  AFP  of  37,839  again.  The  CT\n\ntriphasic  scan  from  March  1st  showed  some  changes  post-TACE,  with  dense  peripheral  lipiodol\n\n\findicating central necrosis and multiple air foci. The previous tumor thrombus in the right portal vein\n\nis  no  longer  enhancing.  Theres  no  evidence  of  new  HCC,  but  some  small  lymph  nodes  remain\n\nunchanged.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThe CT scan results are reassuring in terms of the lack of progression of the tumor. The small lymph\n\nnodes and residual arterialized components will be monitored, but theres no sign of metastasis. We\n\nwill continue with the same treatment plan: TACE and Sorafenib. Well also need a follow-up in four\n\nweeks.\n\nPatient:\n\nThats a relief. Ill continue the treatment as advised.\n\nDoctor:\n\nIve  noted  that  your  latest  labs  from  March  1st  show  a  urea  level  of  12  and  creatinine  of  0.64.  All\n\nother  values  are  stable.  Well  proceed  with  the  MDT  discussion  for  liver  resection  and  continue\n\nmonitoring your condition closely.\n\nPatient:\n\nThank you for the update, Doctor.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYou're welcome. We'll keep a close eye on your progress and adjust the treatment as needed. Make\n\nsure to stay on top of your follow-ups and lab tests.\n\nPatient:\n\nI havent been answering calls from the clinic recently.\n\n\fDoctor:\n\nWeve been trying to reach you. Please make sure to answer the follow-up calls so we can continue\n\nto track your progress.\n\nPatient:\n\nIll do that. Thank you, Doctor.\n\nDoctor:\n\nTake care, and well speak soon.                                                                                                        \n\nPatient: Good morning, doctor. Im here for my follow-up visit.\n\nDoctor: Good morning! Let's go over your current status. I see that you've been dealing with HCV\n\nand angioinvasive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with a transarterial chemoembolization (TACE)\n\nprocedure done back in January. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient:  I've  been  feeling  weak  and  tired.  I  still  have  some  cough  at  night,  but  I  walk  a  kilometer\n\ndaily. However, my overall energy levels are quite low.\n\nDoctor: I see. Its good that youre staying active despite feeling weak. Lets go over your recent tests\n\nand  imaging.  You  had  a  liver  biopsy  on  27th  January,  and  the  histology  showed  chronic  hepatitis\n\nwith  mild  steatosis  and  focal  portal  fibrosis.  The  fibrosis  was  F1/4,  which  indicates  early-stage\n\nfibrosis.\n\nPatient: Yes, I remember the biopsy results. What do they mean for my treatment plan?\n\nDoctor: The biopsy result indicates that your liver is still in relatively early stages of fibrosis, which is\n\n\fgood.  We  can  continue  managing  the  condition  with  systemic  therapies  like  sorafenib.  As  for  the\n\nTACE  procedure  you  had,  I  see  the  post-procedure  CT  scan  shows  that  the  treated  lesion  in  the\n\nright  liver  lobe  is  responding.  The  dense  peripheral  lipiodol  and  the  central  necrosis  suggest  the\n\ntreatment  was  effective,  though  theres  still  a  small  residual  arterialized  component.  The  previous\n\ntumor  thrombus  in  your  right  portal  vein  isnt  showing  enhancement  in  the  latest  scan,  which  is  a\n\npositive sign.\n\nPatient: Thats reassuring. But I know there was a complication with my HCC rupturing in the right\n\nlung parenchyma. How does that change things?\n\nDoctor: Yes, the rupture of the HCC into the lung was an unexpected complication. Unfortunately,\n\nthis  meant  that  the  planned  right  hepatectomy  had  to  be  canceled.  However,  weve  switched  to\n\nsystemic  therapy  with  sorafenib,  and  you're  still  on  that  treatment.  Ill  be  closely  monitoring  your\n\nprogress. Your last CT scan did not show any interval HCC in the rest of your liver parenchyma, and\n\nthe small locoregional lymph nodes are unchanged.\n\nPatient: Thats good news, but what about my lab results? Are there any significant changes?\n\nDoctor: Lets look at your labs from the past few months:\n\nHB (Hemoglobin): It has stayed stable at around 14 to 15.6 g/dL, which is normal.\n\nTLC (Total Leukocyte Count): It was slightly elevated at 7 on 29th December and 14th March, but its\n\nnow 5.5 on 6th June and 6.1 in September, indicating its coming down.\n\nPlatelets  (PLT):  The  platelets  were  quite  high  at  310  in  March,  but  they're  now  at  158,  which  is  a\n\ngood improvement.\n\n\fBilirubin (T-BIL and D-BIL): Your total and direct bilirubin levels are within normal range now, with\n\nthe latest values being 0.21 for T-BIL and 0.12 for D-BIL.\n\nALT/AST: These liver enzymes are within the normal range, though ALT was a bit higher at 59/58 in\n\nSeptember.\n\nALP (Alkaline Phosphatase): This has decreased from 335 to 90, which is a positive change.\n\nAlbumin: It dropped from 4.6 to 3.3 in March but is now up to 4.04 in June and 4.2 in September,\n\nwhich is a sign of improving liver function.\n\nCreatinine: It's stable at 0.6 to 0.67, which is normal for kidney function.\n\nNa+ and K+: Sodium is stable at 128 to 137, and potassium is within range at 4.1 to 4.53.\n\nAFP  (Alpha-Fetoprotein):  This  is  a  critical  marker  for  HCC.  Your  AFP  dropped  significantly  from\n\n37,839 in December to 2,783 in March, and its now down to 3.58 in June and 4.49 in September,\n\nwhich is an excellent sign.\n\nPatient: So, the lab results seem to show some improvement. What about my medications?\n\nDoctor:  Youre  currently  on  sorafenib  200  mg  twice  daily.  I  see  that  youre  also  taking  omeprazole,\n\ntramadol,  and  paracetamol,  which  are  helping  manage  your  symptoms.  In  addition,  your  recent\n\nprescriptions  include  Qalsan  D,  Surbex  Z,  and  lactulose.  Your  current  treatment  plan  looks  good,\n\nand I recommend continuing with sorafenib.\n\n\fPatient: That sounds like a plan. Are there any changes I should be aware of?\n\nDoctor: Well continue to monitor your condition closely. We plan to do a CT scan in three months\n\nand  follow  up  with  more  lab  work,  including  AFP.  If  you  feel  any  new  symptoms  or  changes,  dont\n\nhesitate to reach out. We will discuss your case in the next MDT meeting, and I will see you again in\n\nthree months.\n\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. Ill continue with the treatment and follow-up plan as advised.\n\nDoctor: Youre welcome. Keep up with your medication, and stay in touch if anything changes. We'll\n\ncontinue to support you through this.\n\nCurrent Medications:\n\nTab Sorafenib 200mg BD\n\nCap Omeprazole\n\nTab Paracetamol\n\nCap Tramadol\n\nTab Qalsan D\n\nTab Surbex Z\n\nCap Carvida 3.125mg BD\n\n\fSyp Lactulose\n\nLab Results:\n\nHB: 15.6 (Dec 15), 14 (Dec 29), 15.6 (Mar 14), 15.6 (Jun 6), 16.3 (Sep 18)\n\nTLC: 5.1 (Dec 15), 7 (Dec 29), 7 (Mar 14), 5.5 (Jun 6), 6.1 (Sep 18)\n\nPLT: 166 (Dec 15), 310 (Dec 29), 310 (Mar 14), 158 (Jun 6), 186 (Sep 18)\n\nT-BIL: 0.5 (Dec 15), 0.6 (Dec 29), 0.6 (Mar 14), 0.21 (Jun 6), 0.34 (Sep 18)\n\nD-BIL: 0.2 (Dec 15), 0.3 (Dec 29), 0.3 (Mar 14), 0.12 (Jun 6), 0.17 (Sep 18)\n\nALT/AST: 29/48 (Dec 15), 29/28 (Dec 29), 29/28 (Mar 14), 27/22 (Jun 6), 59/58 (Sep 18)\n\nALP: 335 (Dec 15), 95 (Dec 29), 95 (Mar 14), 142 (Jun 6), 90 (Sep 18)\n\nAlbumin: 4.6 (Dec 15), 3.3 (Dec 29), 3.3 (Mar 14), 4.04 (Jun 6), 4.2 (Sep 18)\n\nCreatinine: 0.8 (Dec 15), 0.6 (Dec 29), 0.6 (Mar 14), 0.61 (Jun 6), 0.67 (Sep 18)\n\nNa+: 134 (Dec 15), 128 (Dec 29), 128 (Mar 14), 137 (Jun 6), 137 (Sep 18)\n\nK+: 4.53 (Dec 15), 4.1 (Dec 29), 4.1 (Mar 14), 4.31 (Jun 6), 3.9 (Sep 18)\n\n\fINR: 1.01 (Dec 15), 0.96 (Dec 29), 0.96 (Mar 14), 1.01 (Jun 6), 0.98 (Sep 18)\n\nAFP: 37,839 (Dec 15), 2,783 (Dec 29), 2,783 (Mar 14), 3.58 (Jun 6), 4.49 (Sep 18)\n\n\f",

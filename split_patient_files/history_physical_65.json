Let's  review  your  history.  You  were  diagnosed  with  HCV  in  2011  and\n\nhave  been  through  treatment.  You  took  interferon  therapy  for  one  year  and  later  started  DAAs  in\n\n2016. You achieved a sustained virologic response (SVR), and your last PCR on 3rd October 2020\n\nshowed that HCV was not detected.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, thats right.\n\nDoctor:\n\nGood.  Now,  in  terms  of  decompensations,  you've  reported  no  hematemesis,  ascites,  hepatic\n\nencephalopathy (PSE), jaundice, or melena. Thats a good sign.\n\nPatient:\n\nIve never had those issues, thankfully.\n\nDoctor:\n\nGlad to hear. Now, I understand that you've lost about 7 kg in the last month. Can you share more\n\nabout that?\n\n\fPatient:\n\nYes, I noticed my weight dropping recently, but I didnt keep track of it properly.\n\nDoctor:\n\nOkay,  thats  important  information.  Lets  move  on  to  the  scans.  You  had  an  ultrasound  of  your\n\nabdomen on 19th April 2021 from DHQ Sahiwal, which showed a focal solid lesion with well-defined\n\nmargins in segment 4 of the liver, measuring 3.9 x 3.9 cm. There was no ascites.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, I remember that.\n\nDoctor:\n\nOn  the  CT  scan  from  Chughtai  on  7th  May  2021,  it  showed  a  non-cirrhotic  liver  with  a  focal\n\narterialized hepatic lesion in segment 7, measuring 3.9 x 4.3 cm, along with sub-centimeter lymph\n\nnodes at the porta hepatis. The spleen was normal, and there was no ascites.\n\nPatient:\n\nI see.\n\nDoctor:\n\nLets review your lab results from 6th May 2021:\n\nHemoglobin (HB): 14.3\n\nTotal Leukocyte Count (TLC): 7.1\n\n\fPlatelets (PLT): 161\n\nTotal Bilirubin (T-BIL): 0.9\n\nDirect Bilirubin (D-BIL): 0.3\n\nALT: 56, AST: 40\n\nAlkaline Phosphatase (ALP): 80\n\nAlbumin: 4.3\n\nCreatinine: 0.6\n\nSodium (Na+):\n\nPotassium (K+):\n\nINR: 1.2\n\nAFP (Alpha-Fetoprotein): 5.4\n\nPatient:\n\nOkay.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI also see your anti-HCV test from 19th April 2021 came back negative, which is a good result.\n\n\fPatient:\n\nThat's reassuring.\n\nDoctor:\n\nWell need to keep an eye on your condition. We discussed your case with the multidisciplinary team\n\n(MDT) on 18th May 2021. You were advised to submit the CD of your CT scan for further evaluation.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, I did that.\n\nFollow-up Visit on 12th July 2021\n\nPatient:\n\nI havent had any new symptoms since our last visit, but Im still feeling the effects of the weight loss.\n\nDoctor:\n\nUnderstood. Looking at your history again, you had an SVR with your HCV treatment. Your last PCR\n\nfrom 3rd October 2020 was negative.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, I havent had any viral issues since.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThats  good  news.  Your  CT  scan  from  7th  May  2021  still  shows  a  non-cirrhotic  liver  with  an\n\narterialized hepatic lesion in segment 7, measuring 3.9 x 4.3 cm.\n\n\fPatient:\n\nYes, that lesion is still there.\n\nDoctor:\n\nIn addition, your MRI on 18th May 2021 showed a non-cirrhotic liver and a hepatic lesion in segment\n\n7, measuring 4.8 x 3.7 cm. This lesion demonstrates diffusion restriction and shows intense arterial\n\nphase enhancement with contrast washout in the venous phase.\n\nPatient:\n\nSo, what does that mean for me?\n\nDoctor:\n\nIts  an  indication  of  possible  hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC),  especially  given  its  behavior  on  the\n\nMRI.  The  lesion  is  abutting  the  right  hepatic  vein  branches  but  shows  no  evidence  of  venous\n\ninvasion. The portal vein is patent, and theres no significant biliary dilation.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhats the next step?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWe will continue monitoring it. Your lab results on 5th July 2021 showed:\n\nHemoglobin (HB): 13.3\n\nTotal Leukocyte Count (TLC): 8.3\n\nPlatelets (PLT): 431\n\n\fTotal Bilirubin (T-BIL): 0.43\n\nDirect Bilirubin (D-BIL): 0.13\n\nALT: 24, AST: 21\n\nAlkaline Phosphatase (ALP): 116\n\nAlbumin: 4.1\n\nCreatinine: 0.64\n\nSodium (Na+): 139\n\nPotassium (K+): 4.2\n\nINR: 0.9\n\nAFP: 5.4\n\nYour  MELD-Na  score  is  6,  and  your  Child-Pugh  class  is  5/A,  which  indicates  relatively  preserved\n\nliver function.\n\nPatient:\n\nI see.\n\n\fDoctor:\n\nYour liver biopsy from 6th July 2021 showed moderate steatosis (33-66%), with a METAVIR score\n\nof A1/A3 for activity and F1/F4 for fibrosis. We also did a Fibroscan on 6th July 2021, which showed\n\nno fibrosis (F0) and no steatosis (S0).\n\nPatient:\n\nSo, whats the diagnosis now?\n\nDoctor:\n\nThe  lesion  is  consistent  with  HCC,  and  its  being  monitored  carefully.  Youve  already  had  TACE\n\n(Transarterial Chemoembolization) done on 21st June 2021 to treat the lesion.\n\nPatient:\n\nWill I need more treatment?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWell  continue  to  monitor  your  condition.  The  MDT  will  discuss  your  case  further,  and  we  may\n\nconsider additional treatment options if needed.\n\nPatient:\n\nOkay, thank you for the update, doctor.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYou're welcome. Let's keep track of your condition, and well decide on the next steps together.         \n\n         Patient:\n\nHello, doctor. Im here for my follow-up visit after my wedge resection surgery.\n\n\fDoctor:\n\nHi! Good to see you. How have you been since your last visit?\n\nPatient:\n\nIve  been  okay,  but  Ive  been  feeling  some  weakness  for  the  past  month,  and  Ive  also  been\n\nexperiencing some dyspepsia.\n\nDoctor:\n\nAlright, lets go over your recent medical information and make sure everything is on track. As you\n\nknow, you had surgery for a solitary HCC in segment VII of the liver back in August 2021. How have\n\nyou been recovering since?\n\nPatient:\n\nThe  recovery  was  uneventful  until  I  was  diagnosed  with  mild  COVID-19  on  August  14,  2021,  and\n\nwas shifted to HPTC. I was discharged from there on August 17, 2021.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI see. And how is your breathing now? Any shortness of breath?\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, I still experience some shortness of breath on exertion.\n\nDoctor:\n\nNoted.  Lets  go  over  your  latest  imaging  results.  You  had  a  USG  of  the  abdomen  on  August  12,\n\n2021, which showed a collection in segment VII measuring 5.8 x 5.3 x 5.1 cm, corresponding to a\n\nvolume of 83 ml. There was no ascites, but mild right-sided pleural effusion was seen. Your recent\n\nCT scan from August 24, 2021, confirmed a collection in segment VII, now measuring 4.2 x 3.8 x 0.1\n\n\fcm (about 18.3 ml). The drain tip was in place, and there was minimal pleural effusion.\n\nPatient:\n\nThat sounds concerning. Should I be worried about the collection?\n\nDoctor:\n\nNot necessarily. Its a normal post-surgical finding, but well continue to monitor it closely. Your drain\n\noutput is around 25 ml over the past few days, which is serosanguinous, indicating a good drainage\n\nprocess.\n\nPatient:\n\nSo, whats the plan moving forward?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWe  will  continue  with  your  current  medication,  Rivaroxaban  10mg  daily  for  the  next  21  days.\n\nRegarding your drain, Ill assess whether its time to remove it after a follow-up USG. Id also like to\n\nmonitor  your  liver  function  and  perform  some  routine  blood  tests,  including  CBC,  LFT,  RFT,  and\n\nINR,  to  keep  track  of  your  recovery.  Additionally,  Id  like  a  CT  scan  of  your  liver  using  the  HCC\n\nprotocol for surveillance of any potential recurrence.\n\nPatient:\n\nGot it. Ill make sure to follow up on the tests.\n\nDoctor:\n\nGood.  Lets  also  discuss  the  results  of  your  histopathology.  Your  resected  specimen  showed\n\nwell-differentiated  (G1)  solitary  HCC,  1.5  cm  in  size,  with  internal  necrosis  (30%  viable  tumor).\n\nImportantly,  there  was  no  vascular,  biliary,  or  perineural  invasion,  and  all  margins  were  free  of\n\n\ftumor. This is great news. Your surrounding liver tissue showed mild fibrosis (F1).\n\nPatient:\n\nThat sounds promising.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYes, its reassuring. Youre recovering well, but we need to be vigilant in monitoring for any signs of\n\nrecurrence. Id like to follow up in a few months with another CT scan and blood work, including AFP,\n\nto keep an eye on things.\n\nPatient:\n\nSounds like a good plan. Thank you, doctor.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYoure welcome! Keep taking care of yourself, and well see you soon for the follow-up.\n\nPatient:  \"Doctor,  I  have  been  feeling  a  bit  anxious  about  my  health.  Could  we  go  over  my  latest\n\ntests?\"\n\nDoctor:  \"Of  course.  Let's  take  a  look  at  your  lab  results  and  recent  imaging.  I'll  guide  you  through\n\neverything.\"\n\nPatient:  \"Thank  you.  Here's  what  I've  got.  My  hemoglobin  levels  have  been  steady,  around  14.43\n\ng/dL in December 2021, and its now at 14.7 g/dL as of January 2024. Is that normal?\"\n\nDoctor:  \"Yes,  your  hemoglobin  levels  are  stable  and  within  the  healthy  range.  Theyre  a  good\n\nindicator that your blood health is on track.\"\n\n\fPatient: \"Good to know. What about my total leukocyte count (TLC)? It was 7.86 in December 2021\n\nand dropped to 6.0 in January 2024.\"\n\nDoctor:  \"Your  TLC  has  slightly  decreased  but  is  still  within  normal  limits.  Its  not  something  to  be\n\nconcerned about at the moment.\"\n\nPatient:  \"I  also  noticed  that  my  platelet  count  has  fluctuated.  It  was  197.8  in  December  2021,\n\ndropped to 100 in December 2022, then improved to 180 in May 2023, and is now at 130 in January\n\n2024. Is that something to worry about?\"\n\nDoctor:  \"Platelet  count  can  vary,  but  the  numbers  are  still  within  an  acceptable  range.  Your  count\n\nmight reflect some minor fluctuations but not something we need to be overly concerned about for\n\nnow.\"\n\nPatient: \"Okay, that's a relief. What about my bilirubin levels? My total bilirubin was 0.6 in December\n\n2021, 0.43 in May 2022, 0.44 in December 2022, and 0.52 in January 2024.\"\n\nDoctor:  \"Your  total  bilirubin  is  slightly  elevated  but  remains  well  within  normal  levels.  This  is  not\n\nalarming, but well keep an eye on it in future tests.\"\n\nPatient:  \"My  direct  bilirubin  was  0.23  in  December  2021  and  dropped  to  0.12  in  December  2022,\n\nnow it's at 0.18. Is that a significant change?\"\n\nDoctor: \"The direct bilirubin levels have been stable and slightly increased, but nothing to be overly\n\nconcerned about. Its a minor fluctuation.\"\n\n\fPatient: \"My ALT/AST enzymes were 19/19 in December 2021, then 35/24 in May 2022, and 30/22\n\nin April 2023, now 36/28 in January 2024. Should I be worried?\"\n\nDoctor:  \"Your  liver  enzymes  are  a  bit  elevated  compared  to  the  baseline,  but  theyre  still  not  at\n\nalarmingly high levels. Well continue to monitor this, especially considering your liver condition.\"\n\nPatient: \"What about ALP? It was 87 in December 2021 and stayed stable around 80 in 2022 and\n\n2023. It's now at 86 in January 2024.\"\n\nDoctor:  \"ALP  is  stable,  and  its  good  to  see  it  hasnt  changed  much.  This  is  within  a  normal  range,\n\nwhich is promising.\"\n\nPatient:  \"And  hows  my  albumin  level?  It  was  4.57  in  December  2021,  4.5  in  May  2022,  4.48  in\n\nDecember 2022, and is now 4.5 in January 2024.\"\n\nDoctor: \"Your albumin levels are stable, which is a positive sign that your liver is functioning well and\n\nyoure not experiencing significant protein loss.\"\n\nPatient: \"How about my creatinine? It was 0.76 in May 2022, 0.84 in April 2023, and 0.83 in January\n\n2024.\"\n\nDoctor: \"Your creatinine levels have remained steady and are within normal limits. This shows that\n\nyour kidney function is also stable.\"\n\nPatient: \"My sodium was 139 in December 2021, 140 in May 2022, 140 in April 2023, and is now\n\n138. Should I be concerned?\"\n\n\fDoctor:  \"Your  sodium  is  slightly  lower  in  January,  but  it's  still  within  a  normal  range.  Theres  no\n\nimmediate concern here.\"\n\nPatient:  \"What  about  my  potassium?  It  was  4.3  in  December  2021,  4.2  in  May  2022,  3.9  in  April\n\n2023, and now 4.43 in January 2024.\"\n\nDoctor: \"Your potassium levels are a bit higher now, which is fine as long as its within the reference\n\nrange. Its important to monitor for any symptoms, but it looks good for now.\"\n\nPatient:  \"My  INR  was  1.01  in  December  2021,  0.95  in  May  2022,  1.04  in  April  2023,  and  0.94  in\n\nJanuary 2024. Is this okay?\"\n\nDoctor: \"Your INR is stable and within the healthy range, so theres nothing to worry about here.\"\n\nPatient: \"Hows my AFP? It was 4.64 in December 2021, 4.29 in May 2022, 4.7 in April 2023, and\n\nnow its 5.24 in January 2024.\"\n\nDoctor:  \"Your  AFP  level  has  increased  slightly,  but  its  still  within  the  expected  range  for  someone\n\nwith your condition. Well keep monitoring it.\"\n\nPatient: \"I also see my MELD-Na score. It was 7 in December 2021, 6 in May 2022, 7 in April 2023,\n\nand 8 in January 2024. Should I be concerned?\"\n\nDoctor: \"The MELD-Na score has increased a bit, which reflects some changes in liver function. It's\n\nsomething we need to keep an eye on, but its not an emergency at this point.\"\n\nPatient: \"What about the CT and MRI scans? I know you mentioned some issues.\"\n\n\fDoctor:  \"Yes,  your  imaging  showed  that  the  small  lesion  in  segment  VIII  of  the  liver  could  be  a\n\nrecurrence  of  HCC.  The  latest  MRI  from  January  2024  confirms  a  1.7  cm  lesion,  which  is\n\nconcerning. We'll need to proceed with further evaluations.\"\n\nPatient: \"Whats the next step then?\"\n\nDoctor:  \"Well  discuss  this  with  the  multidisciplinary  team.  For  now,  we'll  look  at  options  like\n\nradiofrequency  ablation  (RFA)  or  surgical  resection.  We  also  need  to  refer  you  to  interventional\n\nradiology for an evaluation.\"\n\nPatient: \"I understand. What should I do next?\"\n\nDoctor:  \"I  recommend  that  we  arrange  for  further  imaging  and  review  the  situation  with  our  team.\n\nWe  may  proceed  with  RFA,  and  well  also  monitor  your  overall  liver  health.  Well  discuss  the\n\ntreatment options further based on those results.\"\n\nPatient: \"I see. Thank you for explaining everything to me, Doctor.\"\n\nDoctor: \"You're welcome. We'll stay on top of it and ensure you're getting the best care possible.\"\n\n\f",

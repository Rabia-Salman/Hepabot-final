    "raw_text": "Gender: Male\n\nAge: 47\n\nMRN: 794125\n\nDiagnosis: Cholangiocarcinoma\n\nHistory and Physical:\n\nPatient:\n\nDoctor, Ive been feeling very unwell for the last 20 days. I have jaundice, loss of appetite, itching,\n\nand trouble sleeping. Ive also been losing weightabout 5 to 6 kg in the past 20 days.\n\nDoctor:\n\nIm sorry to hear that. Lets go through your medical history. Youve been diagnosed with hepatitis C\n\nfive years ago, and you were treated with interferon and DAAs for three months. You had sustained\n\nviral response, correct?\n\nPatient:\n\nYes,  thats  right.  I  had  treatment  with  interferon  and  DAAs  for  three  months,  and  I  achieved  a\n\nsustained viral response. My last HCV PCR test was on 24th July 2024, and it came back detected.\n\nDoctor:\n\nAlright. Let's take a look at your current condition. You mentioned feeling nauseous, losing weight,\n\nand having jaundice, but no significant issues with hematemesis, ascites, or encephalopathy. Have\n\nyou had any blood transfusions?\n\nPatient:\n\nNo, I havent had any blood transfusions, and I havent been feeling feverish or having night sweats\n\neither.\n\n\fDoctor:\n\nThank you for that information. Your current medications include Urso, Heparitum, Weepo, Jardin,\n\nand  Itopride.  You  have  no  allergies,  and  your  family  medical  history  doesnt  show  any  major\n\nconditions like diabetes, hypertension, cancer, or tuberculosis.\n\nPatient:\n\nCorrect, no allergies or major medical history. Im married with five children and work as a rickshaw\n\ndriver. I dont smoke, drink, or have any addictions. Ive also completed intermediate education.\n\nDoctor:\n\nNoted. On your physical examination, you were conscious and oriented with a Glasgow Coma Scale\n\nof  15/15.  Your  cardiovascular  and  respiratory  systems  were  normal,  and  your  abdomen  was  soft,\n\nnon-tender, and non-distended.\n\nNow, regarding your imaging tests, you had an endoscopy done on 5th August 2024, which showed\n\nerosive  congestive  gastropathy.  Your  ultrasound  report  from  the  same  date  showed  an  enlarged\n\nliver, thick-walled gallbladder, and dilated common bile duct with a soft tissue mass near the head of\n\nthe pancreas. There were also enlarged lymph nodes around the porta hepatis and peripancreatic\n\nregion, but your spleen, kidneys, and pancreas appeared normal.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, I was told about the mass near the pancreas.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYoure correct. Were also waiting on the results of a CT scan, but it hasnt been reported yet.\n\nNow,  let's  look  at  your  lab  results.  Your  hemoglobin  is  stable  at  13.2,  and  your  platelet  count  has\n\n\fincreased  from  174  to  274.  Your  total  bilirubin  has  gone  up  from  18.6  to  27.46,  and  your  direct\n\nbilirubin  from  15.2  to  24.17.  Your  ALT  and  AST  are  also  slightly  elevated,  and  your  alkaline\n\nphosphatase level is down from 642 to 302.\n\nPatient:\n\nSo, what does all of this mean?\n\nDoctor:\n\nThe lab results, especially the rising bilirubin levels, suggest that theres ongoing obstruction of your\n\nbile ducts. Based on your ultrasound and lab results, we are concerned that this may be a malignant\n\nobstruction in your common bile duct (CBD).\n\nPatient:\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWe will need to send fresh labs and do a triphasic CT scan to get a clearer picture. In the meantime,\n\nIve  prescribed  Fenargan  for  your  itching.  Well  also  arrange  for  an  ERCP  (Endoscopic  Retrograde\n\nCholangiopancreatography)  and  stenting.  If  needed,  we  may  discuss  a  Whipple  procedure  as  a\n\ndefinitive treatment. Well wait for the radiology report, and this will be discussed in a multidisciplinary\n\nteam (MDT) meeting.\n\nPatient:\n\nI understand. Thank you, doctor.\n\nFollow-up on 13th August 2024\n\n\fPatient:\n\nDoctor, Im here for a follow-up. My jaundice is still there, and Ive lost more weightanother 5-6 kg in\n\nthe past few weeks. The itching hasnt improved much either.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThank you for updating me. Your weight loss and jaundice are still significant concerns. Your recent\n\nCT  scan  from  12th  August  has  shown  a  heterogeneously  enhancing  mass  in  your  CBD,  which  is\n\nconcerning for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, with involvement of the left biliary system and some\n\nenlarged lymph nodes.\n\nThe  possibility  of  biliary  invasive  hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC)  is  less  likely  but  cannot  be\n\ncompletely excluded. This needs further correlation with tumor markers and viral serology.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhat are the next steps?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWell  proceed  with  a  biopsy  using  endoscopic  ultrasound  to  confirm  the  diagnosis.  Since  your  CT\n\nscan  indicates  a  mass,  Ill  refer  you  to  oncology  for  further  management.  Unfortunately,  based  on\n\nthese findings, it seems you are not a candidate for curative surgery at this time.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhat do you mean by not being a candidate for surgery?\n\nDoctor:\n\nThe mass in your biliary system, along with the enlarged lymph nodes, suggests that this may be a\n\nmetastatic  cancer.  Curative  surgery  would  be  difficult  because  of  the  extent  of  the  disease.\n\n\fHowever, we will continue to explore the best possible treatment options for you.\n\nPatient:\n\nOkay, thank you for explaining, doctor.\n\nFollow-up on 4th September 2024\n\nPatient:\n\nDoctor,  Im  back  for  my  follow-up.  I  still  have  jaundice,  and  the  weight  loss  continues.  The\n\nhemorrhoids are still troubling me too.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI see. Your ultrasound and CT scans confirm that the biliary obstruction is likely due to a mass in the\n\nCBD. The diagnosis is still pointing toward a cholangiocarcinoma, and based on your lab results, we\n\ncan see that your bilirubin is down a little bit, but its still elevated. Your platelets and ALT/AST levels\n\nare stable.\n\nPatient:\n\nIs there anything new in my reports?\n\nDoctor:\n\nYes,  your  lab  results  from  the  latest  tests  are  mostly  similar  to  before,  with  slight  changes  in  your\n\nbilirubin levels. Your CT scan shows a large filling defect in the CBD, consistent with a mass causing\n\nnarrowing and stricture in the biliary system. Well need to proceed with endoscopic ultrasound for\n\nbiopsy and further analysis.\n\nPatient:\n\n\fWhats the next step for treatment?\n\nDoctor:\n\nGiven  that  this  seems  to  be  a  malignancy,  were  focusing  on  supportive  care  and  symptom\n\nmanagement  at  the  moment.  Youll  need  to  see  an  oncologist  for  further  treatment  options,  as\n\nsurgery might not be an option due to the extent of the disease.\n\nPatient:\n\nThank you for everything, doctor.\n\n\f",

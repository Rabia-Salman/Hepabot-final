It comes with nausea.\n\nDoctor: Have you ever passed a stone?\n\nPatient: No, I havent. But Ive had episodes of hematuria.\n\nDoctor: Are you on any treatment right now?\n\nPatient: I was given medical dissolution therapy.\n\nDoctor: Any other health conditions or comorbidities?\n\nPatient: No, nothing else.\n\nDoctor: Ive reviewed your ultrasound (USG KUB). It shows you have a left renal calculus. Im going\n\nto  order  a  few  tests  for  further  evaluation:  CT  KUB,  Urine  Culture  and  Routine  Examination,  and\n\nSerum Creatinine.\n\nFollow-up  17/08/23 (Urology)\n\nDoctor: You're following up for left flank pain, correct?\n\n\fPatient:  Yes,  it's  still  there.  I  also  experience  hesitation  while  passing  urine  on  and  off,  and  the\n\nnausea continues.\n\nDoctor:  Your  serum  creatinine  is  0.99,  which  is  normal.  Urine  culture  came  back  negative.  I\n\nreviewed your CT KUB  it shows a left staghorn calculus causing mild to moderate hydronephrosis.\n\nThere are also additional calculi in the lower pole and interpolar regions.\n\nPatient: Is that serious?\n\nDoctor: It requires intervention. Also, your CT showed hypodense areas in segment IV and VIII of\n\nthe  liver.  We  need  an  ultrasound  to  correlate  those  liver  findings.  For  the  kidney  stone,  we  will\n\nproceed with a PCNL (Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy). Anesthesia will evaluate you before surgery.\n\nHPB & LTx Clinic  04/07/24\n\nDoctor: Hello Anita. Youve come to us with lower back pain?\n\nPatient: Yes, but I also wanted to follow up on the liver issue. I had PCNL for my left renal stones\n\nlast  year  in  August.  But  when  I  got  a  CT  KUB  in  August  2023,  they  found  hypodense  areas  in\n\nsegment  IV  and  VIII  of  my  liver.  Nothing  was  done  at  that  time.  Then  in  May  2024,  I  had  an\n\nultrasound again, and they said the liver lesion had grown.\n\nDoctor: I see. And what did the biopsy show?\n\nPatient: It turned out to be moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.\n\nDoctor: Any other symptoms like jaundice, weight loss, hematemesis, or fevers?\n\n\fPatient: No, none of those. Also, my viral markers are negative. No history of blood transfusions or\n\nascites.\n\nDoctor: Any allergies?\n\nPatient: Yes, Im allergic to contrast.\n\nDoctor: Lets go through your investigation reports.\n\nUSG  Abdomen  (30.05.24)  shows  Grade  I  fatty  liver  and  a  focal  liver  defect  (6.0  x  4.9  x  5.5  cm  in\n\ncaudate lobe). Left renal calculi are still present.\n\nCT Scan (31.05.24) shows a necrotic liver lesion (6.81 x 6.07 cm in segment IV). No arterial phase\n\nenhancement or washout.\n\nLiver  Biopsy  (12.06.24)  confirms  moderately  differentiated  adenocarcinoma.  CK7  and  CAM5.2  are\n\npositive. HepPar1 and CDX2 are negative.\n\nOGD (28.06.24): Pangastritis, otherwise normal.\n\nColonoscopy (28.06.24): Two small rectal polyps, solitary rectal ulcer syndrome on biopsy.\n\nBilateral Mammography (01.07.24): BIRADS III in left breast with a 1.2 x 0.5 cm hypoechoic lesion.\n\nPET Scan (04.07.24): Report awaited.\n\nLab Results (27.06.24):\n\n\fHemoglobin: 9.6\n\nTLC: 8.1\n\nPlatelets: 272\n\nT-BIL: 0.6\n\nD-BIL: 0.2\n\nALT/AST: 36/25\n\nALP: 148\n\nAlbumin: 4.9\n\nAFP: 7.57\n\nCEA: <1.73\n\nCA125: 10.0\n\nCA19-9: 14.9\n\nDoctor: Your viral markers (HBsAg, Anti-HCV) are negative. ECOG performance score is 0, BMI is\n\n40.03,  and  your  blood  group  is  A  positive.  Do  you  have  any  history  of  addiction,  depression,  or\n\n\fthoughts of self-harm?\n\nPatient: No, none at all. I dont smoke or drink. Mentally, I feel fine.\n\nDoctor:  Thats  good  to  hear.  Based  on  the  CT  and  biopsy  findings,  we  suspect  intrahepatic  ductal\n\ncholangiocarcinoma.  If  your  PET  scan  doesnt  show  disease  elsewhere,  we  will  plan  a  central\n\nhepatectomy. If other lesions are seen, well reassess our approach.\n\nHPB & LTx Clinic  Follow-up on 11/07/24\n\nDoctor:  Welcome  back.  Weve  reviewed  your  PET  scan.  It  shows  a  hypermetabolic  hepatic  mass\n\nand a hypermetabolic hepatic hilar lymph node, which is likely metastatic.\n\nPatient: That sounds serious.\n\nDoctor:  It  does  indicate  a  poor  prognostic  factor,  but  the  good  news  is  the  lymph  node  can  be\n\nremoved during surgery. We'll proceed with central hepatectomy.\n\nPatient: Will I need any treatment after surgery?\n\nDoctor: Yes, we will recommend adjuvant chemotherapy after the surgery to reduce recurrence risk.\n\nYoull also be under surveillance post-treatment for early detection if anything returns.\n\nPatient: Alright, I understand.\n\nDoctor: Were referring you to the coordinator to schedule your surgery. Youve been strong through\n\nthis, and well do our best going forward.\n\n\fPost-Surgical Follow-Up  13/08/24\n\nPatient: Im here for follow-up after my central hepatectomy.\n\nDoctor:  Great  to  see  you  again.  Lets  review  your  recovery  and  any  concerns  in  our  next  session.\n\nWell also evaluate your next steps with the oncology team.

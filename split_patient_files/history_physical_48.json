    "raw_text": "Gender: Male\n\nAge: 59\n\nMRN: 813351\n\nDiagnosis: Cholangiocarcinoma\n\nHistory and Physical:\n\nPatient: Doctor, I've been having severe abdominal pain, extreme itching, difficulty sleeping, fatigue,\n\nand significant weight loss over the last three weeks.\n\nDoctor: I understand. Can you tell me more about when the pain started?\n\nPatient: It began suddenly three weeks ago. The pain has been constant, and there's nothing that\n\nseems to make it better or worse.\n\nDoctor: Along with the pain, you mentioned extreme itching and difficulty sleeping. Is the itching all\n\nover your body?\n\nPatient: Yes, it's been all over, and its making it hard to sleep.\n\nDoctor: Its also affecting your energy levels, I see. You mentioned feeling fatigued and sleepy during\n\nthe day?\n\nPatient: Yes, I feel very tired all the time, and I struggle to stay awake during the day. I also lost 7\n\nkgs in just two weeks.\n\nDoctor: I see. Well need to investigate this further. Ill look at your lab results, starting with your viral\n\nmarkers.  Your  HCV  and  HBV  tests  from  August  15th  were  negative,  which  is  good.  Youve  had\n\ntreatment with interferon and DAA in the past and have achieved a sustained virologic response.\n\n\fPatient: Yes, that's right. But these symptoms are still bothering me.\n\nDoctor: Well definitely look into this more. Let's review some other aspects. Im noting that youve had\n\njaundice for about a month, but no hematemesis, melena, or ascites. No blood transfusions either.\n\nHave you had any fevers or night sweats?\n\nPatient: No, no fevers or night sweats.\n\nDoctor: Your history of diabetes is also important to note, and I see that youve had no surgeries in\n\nthe past. Are you taking any medications?\n\nPatient: Yes, Im on several medications. I take esomeprazole 40mg once a day, levijon three times\n\na day, rifaximin once a day, ursodeoxycholic acid twice daily, ertugliflozin-sitagliptin twice a day, and\n\nphloroglunicol in case of pain.\n\nDoctor: Okay, Ill make a note of all that. Now, your family history is significant. Your mother passed\n\naway from liver cancer, and your father from kidney-related issues. Your sister has diabetes.\n\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\n\nDoctor:  Now,  let's  talk  about  the  results  of  your  recent  investigations.  The  ultrasound  from  August\n\n26th  showed  an  enlarged  fatty  liver  with  grade  I  dilatation  of  the  intrahepatic  biliary  duct.  The  CT\n\nscan  from  September  2nd  revealed  an  ill-defined  mass  at  the  bifurcation  of  the  common  hepatic\n\nduct, which is causing moderate dilatation in the intrahepatic biliary ducts.\n\nPatient: That doesnt sound good, Doctor.\n\n\fDoctor: You're right. The CT scan from PKLI on September 11th showed a soft tissue mass at the\n\nconfluence  of  the  hepatic  ducts,  measuring  about  2  x  1.5  cm.  This  mass  is  causing  mild  biliary\n\ndilatation and is affecting both the right hepatic artery and narrowing the left portal vein. Theres no\n\nevidence of cirrhosis, but the biliary system is impacted.\n\nPatient: Im worried about what this could mean for me.\n\nDoctor: I understand your concern. Based on these findings and your symptoms, I suspect you may\n\nhave  a  Klatskin  tumor.  Well  need  more  detailed  imaging  and  tests  to  confirm  this,  but  this  is  a\n\npossibility.\n\nPatient: Whats the next step?\n\nDoctor:  Well  schedule  a  CT  scan  with  the  HCC  protocol  to  assess  the  tumors  morphology  and  to\n\nhelp us decide on the best course of treatment. Surgery could be an option, but we'll need to gather\n\nmore information first.\n\nPatient: What are the risks of surgery?\n\nDoctor: Surgery carries a 3-4% risk of mortality and a 10% risk of morbidity. However, the five-year\n\nsurvival rate for patients with this condition post-surgery is about 40%. Its important to weigh these\n\nrisks, but surgery is a potential treatment.\n\nPatient: I understand. What else do I need to do in the meantime?\n\nDoctor: Youll need to continue with your current medications and focus on improving your physical\n\n\factivity and controlling your blood sugar levels. Well also schedule an ERCP to assess the bile duct\n\nfurther.\n\nPatient: Okay, thank you for explaining all of this.\n\nDoctor: Youre welcome. Well keep monitoring your condition closely. After the CT scan and further\n\ntests,  well  determine  the  next  steps.  Dont  hesitate  to  reach  out  if  you  have  any  questions  in  the\n\nmeantime.\n\nPatient: I will. Thank you, Doctor.\n\nFollow-Up Visit (September 16, 2024)\n\nDoctor: How have you been feeling since your last visit?\n\nPatient: The pain is still there, and Im still experiencing the itching and fatigue.\n\nDoctor:  We  will  continue  monitoring  these  symptoms  closely.  Your  lab  results  are  showing  an\n\nincrease  in  your  bilirubin  levels,  which  could  be  indicative  of  worsening  biliary  obstruction.  Your\n\nrecent  CT  scan  didnt  show  any  major  changes,  but  it  confirmed  the  mass  and  its  effects  on  the\n\nbiliary system.\n\nPatient: Whats the next step?\n\nDoctor:  I  will  consult  with  the  multidisciplinary  team  to  discuss  possible  surgery  options.  Well  also\n\nperform an ERCP to evaluate the bile ducts more thoroughly. Its crucial we understand the extent of\n\nthe biliary stricture.\n\n\fPatient: Okay, Doctor. What about my other medications?\n\nDoctor: Keep taking your current medications as prescribed. We might need to adjust them based\n\non the results of further tests.\n\nPatient: Thank you for your care.\n\nDoctor:  You're  welcome.  We'll  proceed  with  the  treatment  plan  and  follow  up  with  you  after  the\n\nERCP and additional tests.\n\nFollow-Up Visit (October 23, 2024)\n\nDoctor: How have things been since your last visit?\n\nPatient: My pedal edema has gotten worse in the last two weeks, and Ive had some swelling in my\n\nlegs.\n\nDoctor:  I  see.  Let's  review  your  imaging  and  lab  results.  The  ERCP  you  had  on  October  4th\n\nrevealed  a  stricture  in  the  bile  duct,  and  we  obtained  a  biopsy  from  it.  The  biopsy  suggests\n\ncholangiocarcinoma, which is consistent with the initial diagnosis of a Klatskin tumor.\n\nPatient: What does this mean for me?\n\nDoctor:  Well  need  to  discuss  surgical  options  in  more  detail,  particularly  the  left  hepatectomy  and\n\nbile duct excision. This will be followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. The surgery carries some risks,\n\nbut it's important to proceed with the treatment.\n\n\fPatient: I understand. What should I expect next?\n\nDoctor:  The  multidisciplinary  team  will  meet  to  finalize  the  treatment  plan.  We'll  also  continue\n\nmonitoring  your  liver  function  through  labs  and  imaging.  Lets  keep  focused  on  improving  your\n\nphysical activity and managing your blood sugar.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your guidance.\n\nDoctor: Of course, were here for you every step of the way.\n\n\f",

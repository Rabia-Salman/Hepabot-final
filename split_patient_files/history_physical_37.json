I weigh 16.20 kg, and Im from Mianwali. I have five\n\nsiblings,  all  of  whom  are  healthy.  My  family  history  is  unremarkable,  and  I  was  born  via  normal\n\nvaginal  delivery  at  term  with  no  complications.  Im  up-to-date  with  all  my  vaccinations,  and  my\n\ndevelopment has been normal.\n\nDoctor:\n\nHello, Dua. I see you are here today for an opinion. Can you tell me more about your health history?\n\nPatient:\n\nI  had  some  issues  about  a  year  ago,  when  I  was  in  the  U.S.  I  developed  abdominal  pain  and\n\nswelling. My doctors there referred me to Mianwali because my liver was enlarged. They did some\n\ntests, and then I was sent to the Childrens Hospital Lahore (CHL). I also have a history of fits, which\n\nIm still dealing with.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI understand. How has your liver been since then? Have you noticed anything unusual like ascites\n\n(fluid buildup)?\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, I do have ascites. The doctors have been monitoring it. They diagnosed me with cryptogenic\n\nliver cirrhosis and autoimmune hepatitis. My past surgeries have been unremarkable, and theres no\n\n\fremarkable family history of similar conditions.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThank  you  for  sharing  that  with  me.  Lets  take  a  look  at  your  lab  results  from  earlier  tests.  Your\n\nbilirubin levels are normal, but your ALT and AST are elevated, which indicates some liver stress.\n\nYour INR is 1.13, which is within the normal range. Well need to monitor these closely.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYour abdominal ultrasound from June showed altered liver texture with gross ascites, and your CT\n\nscan results confirmed a congested liver. Your liver biopsy from July showed chronic hepatitis with\n\nminimal activity and cirrhosis. No malignancy was found, which is a good sign.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYour medications currently include Carveda, Spiromide, and Vitamin K, which are helping manage\n\nyour  condition.  You  will  also  continue  with  these  medications  as  we  proceed  with  your  treatment\n\nplan.\n\nDoctor:\n\nBased  on  your  condition,  we  will  need  to  conduct  a  few  more  tests.  Id  recommend  checking  for\n\nANA,  IgG,  ceruloplasmin,  and  24-hour  urinary  copper  levels.  A  liver  transplant  is  likely  to  be  the\n\ndefinitive  treatment  for  you.  We  will  also  need  to  perform  a  follow-up  abdominal  ultrasound,  CT\n\nscan, and EGD from CHL.\n\nDoctor:\n\nIn the meantime, you will need to follow a salt-free diet. Your medications will continue as they are,\n\nbut please bring a donor for your next visit. It will be important to have a donor who is 18 or older, as\n\nthe prospective donor is currently 15 years old.\n\n\fFollow-Up Visit on 29th August, 2023:\n\nPatient:\n\nHello, doctor. Im Dua Fatima again. I have been feeling feverish with abdominal distension.\n\nDoctor:\n\nLets  check  your  condition.  I  notice  grade  1  clubbing  and  some  prominent  superficial  veins  in  your\n\nabdomen.  Your  liver  is  palpable,  but  theres  no  ascites  at  the  moment.  Your  CT  scan  from  30th\n\nAugust confirms hepatosplenomegaly with a congested liver and ascites.\n\nDoctor:\n\nWe also did an ultrasound, which showed that your liver is enlarged with a heterogeneous texture,\n\nand  the  caudate  lobe  is  prominent.  Your  liver  biopsy  from  July  confirmed  chronic  hepatitis  with\n\ncirrhosis,  but  no  malignancy  was  detected.  Your  liver  is  still  under  significant  stress,  and  the\n\ntreatments will continue to focus on managing that.\n\nDoctor:\n\nWe will continue with your salt-free diet, and Im prescribing Aldactone and Inderal to help manage\n\nyour liver function. Please take the recommended medications for constipation and other supportive\n\ncare.  We  will  be  referring  you  to  the  liver  transplant  team  regarding  the  donor  workup.  If  you\n\nexperience any changes, please contact us.\n\nFollow-Up Visit on 6th September, 2023:\n\nPatient:\n\nDoctor, Ive been having a fever and abdominal distension again. My condition seems a bit worse.\n\n\fDoctor:\n\nLets  check  you  over.  You  still  have  grade  1  clubbing,  but  your  liver  is  now  3  cm  below  the  costal\n\nmargin,  and  ascites  has  returned.  Well  continue  monitoring  your  liver  function  with  Aldactone  and\n\nInderal, and Im adding Vitamin K as well.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI see that we need to proceed with more lab tests, including Protein C, Antithrombin III, CBC, LFT,\n\nand INR. Well follow up with you after 10 days and adjust treatments accordingly.\n\nFollow-Up Visit on 18th September, 2023:\n\nPatient:\n\nHello,  doctor.  Im  feeling  much  better  now.  My  condition  has  stabilized,  and  Im  not  having  fever\n\nanymore.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThats good to hear. You are still an active and alert child. We have reviewed your lab results, and I\n\nsee youre doing better. The ultrasound from 22nd August confirmed an enlarged liver with nodular\n\nechotexture, but theres no ascites at the moment. The CT scan from 30th August showed signs of\n\nBudd Chiari Syndrome along with chronic liver disease changes.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYour  Shearwave  elastography  from  18th  September  indicates  F4  stage  of  hepatic  fibrosis,  so  we\n\nneed  to  continue  careful  monitoring  of  your  liver.  Youre  doing  well  on  your  medications,  and  well\n\nproceed with your next steps.\n\n\fFollow-Up Visit on 24th October, 2023:\n\nPatient:\n\nDoctor, Im back for my follow-up. Ive been feeling fine, except for a few issues with mouth ulcers.\n\nDoctor:\n\nIts good to hear that youre feeling well. Your condition still shows signs of Budd Chiari Syndrome,\n\nbut no new issues have arisen. Well continue to monitor your liver function closely with ultrasound\n\nand regular checkups.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYour  latest  ultrasound  shows  an  enlarged  liver  with  a  heterogeneous  texture  and  ascites,  but  well\n\nmonitor  these  developments.  Well  repeat  the  EGD  after  a  year  and  continue  managing  your\n\nmedications.\n\nOverall Plan Moving Forward:\n\nContinue with current medications: Aldactone, Inderal, and Vitamin K.\n\nMaintain a salt-free diet.\n\nFollow up with liver transplant team and donor workup.\n\nMonitor liver function with regular tests and imaging.\n\nRepeat EGD in a year.\n\n\fEnd of Visit Summary:\n\nWe are working closely on your liver transplant evaluation, and well keep an eye on your condition\n\nwith regular follow-ups. If you feel any changes or discomfort, please contact us right away.\n\n\f",

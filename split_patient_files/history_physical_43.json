Along with that,\n\nmy urine has turned dark, my stools are clay-colored, and I feel itchy most of the time. I also have\n\nnausea and Im not eating properly.\n\nDoctor:\n\nWhen did all this start exactly?\n\nPatient:\n\nIt began about two months ago. Before that, I was fine. Then I was told I have something called a\n\nCBD stricture. I had a procedure called an ERCP on the 18th of December. After that, I developed\n\nmild pancreatitis. My amylase was 311. They managed it conservatively.\n\nDoctor:\n\nHave you lost any weight during this time?\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, around 10 kilograms in the last two months.\n\nDoctor:\n\n\fDo you have hepatitis B or C?\n\nPatient:\n\nNo, I was tested and found to be non-reactive for both.\n\nDoctor:\n\nAny history of fever or night sweats?\n\nPatient:\n\nNo, none.\n\nDoctor:\n\nHave you had any previous medical or surgical conditions?\n\nPatient:\n\nNo prior illnesses or surgeries.\n\nDoctor:\n\nAre you taking any medications at the moment?\n\nPatient:\n\nNot  right  now,  but  previously  I  was  taking  Ursodeoxycholic  acid  250  mg  twice  a  day  and\n\nOmeprazole 40 mg once a day.\n\nDoctor:\n\nAny allergies?\n\n\fPatient:\n\nNo allergies.\n\nDoctor:\n\nDo you have any financial concerns or religious/cultural needs for your care?\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, I do have financial issues, but I dont have any special cultural or religious needs.\n\nDoctor:\n\nWhats your occupation?\n\nPatient:\n\nIm a bus driver.\n\nDoctor:\n\nDo you smoke, drink alcohol, or chew tobacco?\n\nPatient:\n\nI used to smoke 30 cigarettes a day but I quit a month ago.\n\nDoctor:\n\nAny family history of diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, TB, or asthma?\n\nPatient:\n\nNo, nothing like that.\n\n\fDoctor:\n\nHave you been feeling depressed or having any suicidal thoughts?\n\nPatient:\n\nNo, nothing like that.\n\nDoctor:\n\nCan you see, speak, walk, and understand clearly?\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, I dont have any impairments.\n\nDoctor (Reviewing Physical Exam):\n\nYoure conscious, alert, and oriented. GCS is 15/15. Your heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear\n\nbilaterally, and your abdomen is soft, non-tender, and not distended.\n\nDoctor (Reviewing Imaging):\n\nOn  17th  December,  your  ultrasound  showed  a  dilated  CBD  up  to  10  mm  and  intra/extrahepatic\n\ncholestasis, with an abrupt change in caliber at the porta hepatis  likely due to a stricture or growth.\n\nThe  ERCP  on  18th  December  revealed  a  stricture  at  the  mid-to-proximal  CBD  junction  with\n\nupstream  biliary  dilation.  A  10  Fr  x  12  cm  plastic  stent  was  placed  across  the  stricture,  and  a\n\nsphincterotomy was done.\n\nA  follow-up  ultrasound  on  21st  December  confirmed  the  stent  placement  and  showed  marked\n\nintrahepatic biliary dilation and early signs of pancreatitis.\n\n\fDoctor (Reviewing CT from 27th December, CMH):\n\nYour liver has cystic lesions, the largest being 2.2 x 2.1 cm in segment V, with hyperenhancement at\n\nthe  rim.  Theres  evidence  of  interstitial  edematous  pancreatitis  with  fluid  collections  extending  into\n\nthe  left  Gerotas  fascia  and  surrounding  areas.  You  also  have  minimal  pleural  effusion  and  some\n\nlung changes.\n\nDoctor (Lab Review):\n\nHere are your labs from 18th and 24th December:\n\nHb: 16.7\n\nWBC: 9.5\n\nPlatelets: 236\n\nTotal Bilirubin: 4.1  15.6\n\nDirect Bilirubin:   13.8\n\nALT/AST: 84  49/74\n\nAlkaline Phosphatase: 542  346\n\nAlbumin:   3.0\n\nCreatinine: 1.1\n\n\fIgG-4: 1160 mg/L\n\nAFP: 2.7 (on 08-Jan-25)\n\nCA19-9: 4.4  417\n\nECOG Performance Status: 01\n\nBMI: 19.23\n\nBlood Group: B+ve\n\nDoctor:\n\nBased on this, we need to get a fresh CT scan and lab results, especially CA19-9 levels. Once we\n\nhave that, well finalize the treatment plan. Please follow up after the investigations.\n\nDate: 06-Feb-2025 | Follow-Up\n\nDoctor:\n\nYou were diagnosed with obstructive jaundice two months ago, and now your provisional diagnosis\n\nis cholangiocarcinoma. Lets review your fresh CT from 29-Jan-25.\n\nDoctor (Reading):\n\nYour  scan  shows  moderate  intrahepatic  biliary  dilatation,  a  CBD  stent  in  place,  and  some\n\npneumobilia. Theres also wall thickening in the biliary channels suggesting cholangitis. Additionally,\n\nyou have acute pancreatitis with a CT severity index of 4 (moderate).\n\n\fDoctor (Lab Results on 29-Jan-25):\n\nHb: 11.9\n\nWBC: 17.4\n\nPlatelets: 659\n\nTotal Bilirubin: 2.26\n\nDirect Bilirubin: 1.81\n\nALT/AST: 130/100\n\nAlkaline Phosphatase: 2145\n\nAlbumin: 3.64\n\nCreatinine: 0.82\n\nNa+: 132\n\nK+: 4.32\n\nINR: 1.05\n\nCA19-9: now down to 279 from 417\n\n\fECOG: 0-1\n\nDoctor:\n\nOur assessment suggests hilar cholangiocarcinoma, possibly extending into the right hepatic ducts.\n\nSurgical  plan  includes  a  Right  hepatectomy  or  Trisectionectomy  with  excision  of  the  biliary  tree,\n\nlymphadenectomy,  and  Roux-en-Y  hepaticojejunostomy.  Chemotherapy  may  follow,  depending  on\n\nhistopathology. Well now coordinate surgery scheduling.\n\nDate: 07-Mar-2025 | 1st Post-op Follow-Up (POD 10)\n\nDoctor:\n\nYou  had  surgery  on  25-Feb-25:  Central  Partial  Hepatectomy  +  Hepaticojejunostomy \n\nfor\n\nCholangiocarcinoma (T2N1Mx). How are you feeling?\n\nPatient:\n\nIm  okay.  The  right  urostomy  bag  hasnt  had  any  output  for  three  days,  but  the  left  drain  has\n\noutputted 210 mL on the first day, and 100 mL per day since.\n\nDoctor (Examining):\n\nYour wound is healing well. Clips are in place, and both drain sites look fine.\n\nDoctor (Reviewing Histopathology):\n\nSegment  IVB  and  V  show  benign  liver  parenchyma  with  marked  portal  edema,  inflammation,\n\ncholangitis, and periductal onion-skin fibrosis, consistent with secondary sclerosing cholangitis.\n\nNo tumor found.\n\n\fLymph  nodes  around  hepatic  artery,  celiac  axis,  and  common  hepatic  artery    all  showed  fibrofatty\n\ntissue with no malignancy.\n\nThe caudate tissue also showed no tumor.\n\n\f",

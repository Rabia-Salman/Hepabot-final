    "raw_text": "Gender: Female\n\nAge: 5\n\nMRN: 709356\n\nDiagnosis: Budd-Chiari syndrome\n\nHistory and Physical:\n\nPatient:  Doctor,  my  daughter  has  been  suffering  from  abdominal  distension,  jaundice,  fever,  and\n\ndecreased urine output for the last month.\n\nDoctor:  I  see,  thank  you  for  the  details.  Lets  go  over  some  information.  Based  on  the  lab  results\n\nfrom  September  2022,  I  can  see  a  few  concerning  findings.  Her  GGT  was  54,  albumin  was  3.2,\n\nbilirubin was elevated at 2.4, and ALT was 485. These could be indicative of liver dysfunction. Her\n\nliver enzymesAST, ALT, and ALPare also elevated, which suggests that the liver is under stress.\n\nPatient:  Yes,  shes  been  feeling  unwell  and  has  had  a  lot  of  discomfort.  What  else  did  the  tests\n\nshow?\n\nDoctor:  Her  white  blood  cell  count  was  14.1,  which  could  indicate  an  ongoing  infection.  The\n\nhemoglobin is 7.7, which is low, indicating that she is anemic. Also, the INR is 1.3, which suggests a\n\nslight clotting issue. Hepatitis A and C tests were negative, which is good, but her liver function is\n\nstill a concern.\n\nPatient: Shes been on some medications, but it doesnt seem like theyve helped much.\n\nDoctor:  I  see  that  shes  currently  taking  Aldactone  and  Lasoride.  These  medications  help  manage\n\nfluid  retention  and  high  blood  pressure  but  might  not  be  addressing  the  underlying  cause  of  her\n\ncondition.  The  ultrasound  done  in  September  showed  a  possible  diagnosis  of  veno-occlusive\n\nsyndrome,  and  the  CT  scan  further  confirmed  a  Budd-Chiari  syndrome  picture,  which  involves\n\n\fhepatic vein obstruction.\n\nPatient: Oh, I see. What does that mean for her?\n\nDoctor: Budd-Chiari syndrome is a serious condition where the blood flow out of the liver is blocked.\n\nThis  causes  pressure  to  build  up  in  the  liver,  leading  to  symptoms  like  ascites,  jaundice,  and  an\n\nenlarged  liver.  The  treatment  usually  involves  addressing  the  liver's  function  and  preventing\n\ncomplications.\n\nPatient: Whats the next step for her?\n\nDoctor: Were planning a virtual clinic tomorrow for further monitoring and would like you to submit\n\nthe  CT  scan  CD  for  review.  Well  also  continue  her  medications  as  discussed.  She  needs  a  liver\n\nbiopsy and further workup, including an EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) to check for varices.\n\nFollow-up on 10-11-2022:\n\nPatient:  Doctor,  I  brought  my  daughter  in  for  a  follow-up.  Shes  still  dealing  with  abdominal\n\ndistension.\n\nDoctor: Thank you for bringing her in. I reviewed her records, and based on her ultrasound, she still\n\nhas  hepatomegaly  (enlarged  liver)  and  a  non-homogenous  liver  texture.  Her  condition  has  been\n\ndiagnosed as Budd-Chiari syndrome. We will continue her current medications, including Aldactone\n\nand Ibert syrup.\n\nPatient: Shes also been having trouble with her breathing and cough. Does that have anything to do\n\nwith her condition?\n\n\fDoctor: Yes, the cough could be a sign of fluid buildup in her lungs due to liver dysfunction. Her liver\n\nenlargement is causing pressure, which can lead to fluid accumulating in her abdomen and lungs.\n\nPatient: Whats the plan moving forward?\n\nDoctor: We will need to test for Hepatitis E and A again, and run additional tests like CBC, LFT, and\n\nRFT to monitor her liver and kidney function. Also, were considering giving her vitamin K injections\n\nonce  a  week.  Ill  also  recommend  a  course  of  Vermox  syrup  for  three  days  and  will  continue  her\n\ncurrent medications. A follow-up in a month is necessary to assess her progress.\n\nFollow-up on 19-01-2023:\n\nPatient: Doctor, shes still having issues with her abdominal distension. Its been two months now.\n\nDoctor: Ive reviewed her latest lab results from December 2022. Her bilirubin level is now 1.5, which\n\nis better, but still elevated. Her liver enzymes (ALT, AST) have decreased, which is a positive sign.\n\nHowever, her INR has risen to 1.8, so we need to be cautious about bleeding.\n\nPatient: Should we change her medications?\n\nDoctor:  No  major  changes  to  her  current  regimen  yet,  but  well  increase  the  vitamin  K  to  twice\n\nweekly,  and  shell  continue  with  Maltofer  syrup  for  iron  supplementation.  We  will  also  start  her  on\n\nInderal for blood pressure management and Lopin EC to help with the liver condition.\n\nFollow-up on 18-09-2024:\n\n\fPatient:  Doctor,  shes  been  having  some  new  symptoms.  Shes  been  vomiting  blood  in  the  last  24\n\nhours, and her abdomen is distended.\n\nDoctor:  This  is  concerning.  I  see  that  her  ascites  has  worsened,  and  she  has  developed  Grade  I\n\nencephalopathy, which could indicate worsening liver function. Her labs show a drop in hemoglobin\n\nto  10.3,  which  means  shes  losing  blood.  Her  platelets  are  low,  which  can  also  be  a  sign  of  liver\n\ndysfunction.  The  CT  scan  from  earlier  this  year  still  shows  hepatomegaly  and  obliterated  hepatic\n\nveins.\n\nPatient: Whats the next step? What do we need to do?\n\nDoctor:  We  need  to  admit  her  for  urgent  care,  especially  with  her  encephalopathy  and  bleeding\n\nepisodes.  A  liver  transplant  remains  the  definitive  treatment  for  her,  but  we  need  to  optimize  her\n\ncondition first. Ill refer her to a specialized children's hospital for further management.\n\nPatient: What else can we do in the meantime?\n\nDoctor:  Continue  the  current  medicationsSpironolactone,  Furosemide,  Vitamin  K,  and  others.  But\n\nthe main priority is to stabilize her condition, and once shes medically optimized, well proceed with\n\nthe transplant discussion.\n\nFollow-up on 18-11-2024:\n\nPatient: Shes still dealing with some of the same symptoms, like ascites, jaundice, and edema.\n\nDoctor:  Yes,  its  been  a  challenging  time  for  her.  The  EGD  results  show  Grade  IV  varices,  which\n\nmeans theres a high risk of bleeding. Weve started her on a beta-blocker (Propranolol) to manage\n\n\fher portal hypertension and control bleeding risks. Her ascites has worsened, and were continuing\n\nher treatment with Spironolactone and Lasoride.\n\nPatient: Is there anything else we should consider?\n\nDoctor:  Well  continue  with  Vitamin  K  every  15  days,  and  Ive  also  prescribed  Propanolol  and  Ora\n\ndrops to manage her liver condition. As always, we need to keep monitoring her closely for any new\n\nsymptoms or complications.\n\nPatient: How long until shes stable enough for a transplant?\n\nDoctor: Well need to focus on stabilizing her condition with medical management. Once we get the\n\nresults  of  the  financial  screening  and  optimization,  we  can  begin  the  discussion  about  the  liver\n\ntransplant.\n\nPlan:\n\nContinue monitoring liver function and manage complications\n\nLiver transplant remains the long-term goal\n\nFollow-up after financial screening\n\n\f",

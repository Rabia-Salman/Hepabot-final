How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Ive been feeling quite weak and dizzy, and Ive had some nausea.\n\nDoctor: Can you tell me more about your history? Have you had any bleeding or other issues?\n\nPatient:  Yes,  Ive  had  some  bleeding  per  rectum  due  to  hemorrhoids,  but  thats  been  an  ongoing\n\nissue related to constipation.\n\nDoctor: I see. Let me check your vitals. You seem stable for now. Your weight is 68 kg, and your\n\nabdomen is soft, non-tender with an umbilical hernia.\n\nPatient: Im concerned about my liver condition. Ive had ascites for the past month.\n\nDoctor: I understand. Your last liver function tests were done on 14th February. Let me go over the\n\nresults:\n\nHemoglobin: 9\n\nPlatelets: 71,000\n\nALT: 29, AST: 42\n\n\fBilirubin: 2.28\n\nAlbumin: 1.9\n\nCreatinine: 0.7\n\nSodium: 139\n\nPotassium: 4\n\nAFP: 8.17\n\nPatient: What does this mean for my treatment?\n\nDoctor:  Based  on  these  results,  your  liver  is  showing  signs  of  cirrhosis  and  ascites.  Weve  started\n\nyou  on  Velpaget  for  your  HCV  relapse,  and  well  monitor  your  progress  closely.  I  also  recommend\n\nsome medications for symptom management like spironolactone and omeprazole.\n\nPatient: Im on spironolactone, but Im worried about the side effects.\n\nDoctor: We will adjust your medications if needed. Youre also scheduled for some follow-up tests to\n\nassess liver function further, and well consider liver transplant options.\n\nDate: 03/03/23\n\nDoctor: Lets go over your CT scan results. The CT shows a single 1.1 cm HCC in segment VI, but\n\nno tumor thrombosis. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Im feeling a bit better, but Im still weak. The dizziness persists.\n\nDoctor:  Understood.  The  good  news  is  that  your  liver  has  some  cirrhotic  changes,  but  we  will\n\n\fcontinue  managing  your  ascites  with  diuretics.  Weve  already  discussed  potential  liver  transplant\n\noptions with your daughter, though her BMI is a bit high.\n\nPatient: Yes, shes willing to be the donor.\n\nDoctor:  Thats  great  to  hear.  Well  proceed  with  testing  her  blood  group  and  make  sure  shes  a\n\nsuitable donor. For now, lets continue your medications and manage your symptoms.\n\nDate: 03/04/23\n\nDoctor: How are you feeling today, Rehana?\n\nPatient: Im still feeling weak, but theres no new pain or discomfort.\n\nDoctor: Lets review your recent lab results:\n\nUrea: 28\n\nCreatinine: 0.9\n\nSodium: 122\n\nPotassium: 5.6\n\nTotal Bilirubin: 1.7\n\nPatient: My abdomen feels okay today. No signs of ascites.\n\nDoctor:  Thats  good  to  hear.  Weve  scheduled  a  follow-up  in  two  weeks,  but  well  continue  your\n\nmedications for now. Lets also check on your hemorrhoids and consider a referral to a GI surgeon\n\nfor further treatment.\n\n\fDate: 18/04/23\n\nDoctor:  Rehana,  your  recent  test  results  show  that  the  liver  transplant  is  the  best  option  for  you.\n\nYour daughter is still interested in being a donor, although she has a BMI of 30.3.\n\nPatient: Yes, shes willing, but Im a bit worried about the BMI issue.\n\nDoctor:  Well  take  care  of  that.  Weve  also  referred  you  to  Dr.  Tauseef  for  the  next  steps  in  the\n\ntransplant process. The good news is your HCV has been under control. Youve been on DAAs, and\n\nwell continue the process based on your test results.\n\nDate: 23/05/23\n\nDoctor: Lets look at your recent results. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: I feel a bit better, though still weak.\n\nDoctor: The last EGD was done on 12/05 due to some melena, and it showed gastric erosions.\n\nPatient: Ive had some abdominal discomfort.\n\nDoctor:  Well  adjust  your  medications  accordingly.  Youll  continue  on  Movicol,  Surbex-Z,  and  other\n\nsupportive meds. Lets plan to repeat the CT scan and AFP in three months.\n\nDate: 30/05/23\n\nDoctor: How are you feeling today, Rehana?\n\nPatient: I still feel some general weakness, and I have some discomfort in my abdomen.\n\nDoctor: On examination, your abdomen is soft, non-tender, and not distended. Your liver condition\n\nseems stable. Youve had mild ascites, but theres no need for tapping. I recommend continuing with\n\nspironolactone, Movicol, and Surbex-Z. Well follow up in four weeks.\n\nDate: 05/06/23\n\n\fDoctor: Lets discuss the next steps for your liver transplant. Your recent medical check-up is clear,\n\nand your workup is complete. Your daughter remains a potential donor, but we will need to evaluate\n\nher BMI further.\n\nPatient: Yes, I understand. Im ready for the transplant process to move forward.\n\nDoctor:  Well  continue  with  the  current  management  plan  and  schedule  a  follow-up  for  your\n\ntransplant date after your daughters exams.\n\nDate: 26/07/23\n\nDoctor: Rehana, its great to see you post-transplant. How have you been feeling?\n\nPatient: Ive been feeling okay, but Im having shortness of breath and difficulty swallowing solid food.\n\nDoctor: Well adjust your medications accordingly. Your liver biopsy shows no vascular invasion, and\n\nyour transplant seems to be progressing well. Well continue monitoring you closely.    27/11/2024 \n\nFollow-up Visit\n\nStatus Post: LDLT Recipient\n\nIndication: HCV/DCLD/HCC\n\nDate of Surgery (DOS): 07/07/23\n\nPost-operative Period: 16 months\n\nStatus Post Mesh Hernioplasty for Incisional Hernia on 22/10/24\n\nPostoperative Day: 35 days\n\nActive Issues: Wound infection (discharge from wound), gapping wound\n\nCurrent Medications:\n\n\fTacrolimus 1mg, oral, twice daily\n\nEntecavir 0.5mg, oral, once daily\n\nSofosbuvir + Velpatasvir 400/100mg, oral, once daily\n\nAmlodipine + Valsartan 5/80mg, oral, once daily\n\nInvestigations:\n\nUSG  Abdomen  (12/11/2024):  Liver  indices  normal.

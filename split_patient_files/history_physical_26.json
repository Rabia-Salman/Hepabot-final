    "raw_text": "Gender: Male\n\nAge: 12\n\nMRN: 770943\n\nDiagnosis: Budd-Chiari syndrome\n\nHistory and Physical:\n\nDoctor: Hello, Husnain. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Ive been experiencing generalized abdominal pain. Its been bothering me for a while now.\n\nDoctor:  I  see.  Lets  go  through  your  history  a  bit  more.  So,  youre  12  years  old  and  weigh  38  kg,\n\nwhich is above the 25th percentile for your age. Is that correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, thats right.\n\nDoctor: And you live in Vehari. Do you have any siblings?\n\nPatient: Yes, I have two older sisters and one older brother. My brother and one of my sisters have\n\nbeen diagnosed with celiac disease.\n\nDoctor: Okay. Now, from what I understand, you were in your usual state of health until you were\n\naround four years old, in 2016, when you developed pain and tenderness in your right abdomen. An\n\nabdominal  ultrasound  suggested  that  you  might  have  Budd-Chiari  Syndrome.  Does  that  sound\n\nfamiliar?\n\nPatient: Yes, thats correct. The doctors told my family that I had Budd-Chiari Syndrome at that time.\n\nDoctor: Since then, have you had any complications like liver issues, swelling, or anything else?\n\n\fPatient: No, I havent had any major complications so far, but I do have some ongoing issues with\n\nabdominal pain.\n\nDoctor: I see. Ill also go over your medical background briefly. You've been hospitalized before for\n\nthis  condition,  but  your  surgical  history  is  unremarkable.  In  terms  of  family  history,  two  of  your\n\nsiblings  have  celiac  disease.  Your  birth  history  and  vaccination  history  are  normal,  and  your\n\ndevelopment has been on track.\n\nPatient: Yes, everything is fine with that.\n\nDoctor:  Great.  Let's  move  on  to  your  current  medications.  Youre  taking  Tab  Inderal  10  mg  twice\n\ndaily, Cap Evion 250 mg once daily, D-Max drops 3 drops once daily, Tab Aldactone 25 mg once\n\ndaily, and folic acid. Is that correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, thats correct.\n\nDoctor: Now, Ive also looked at your recent lab results. Heres what I found:\n\nBilirubin: 1.3\n\nALT: 58\n\nAST: 42\n\nINR: 1.4\n\n\fHemoglobin: 9.4\n\nWhite Blood Cell count: 3.8\n\nPlatelets: 215\n\nSodium: 135\n\nPotassium: 4.4\n\nUrea: 31\n\nCreatinine: 0.6\n\nPatient: What do those results mean, doctor?\n\nDoctor:  Your  bilirubin  and  liver  enzymes  are  slightly  elevated,  but  nothing  alarming.  Your\n\nhemoglobin is a little low, which might explain some fatigue or weakness. Well keep an eye on that.\n\nYour kidney function seems fine, though, as your creatinine and urea levels are normal.\n\nPatient: Okay, I understand.\n\nDoctor: In terms of radiology, your recent ultrasound of the abdomen shows a mildly enlarged liver\n\nwith  a  few  varices  in  the  hypertrophied  caudate  lobe.  Theres  also  a  chronic  thrombus  in  the  main\n\nhepatic veins, which is consistent with the sequelae of Budd-Chiari Syndrome.\n\nPatient: I see. Is that serious?\n\n\fDoctor:  It's  something  we  need  to  monitor  closely.  We  also  have  some  old  CT  scan  findings  that\n\nsuggest narrowing and stretching of the IVC and intra-hepatic veins, which is part of the Budd-Chiari\n\npicture.\n\nPatient: Okay, so whats the next step, doctor?\n\nDoctor: Were going to do some further screenings. First, we need a full financial screening, and after\n\nthat, well start a baseline workup for chronic liver disease. A CT triphasic will be done to rule out any\n\nsigns of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and well also do an ultrasound shearwave study. A liver\n\nbiopsy is also part of the plan.\n\nFollow-up Visit on 10/06/2024\n\nDoctor: How are you doing today, Husnain?\n\nPatient:  Im  feeling  a  bit  better.  The  abdominal  pain  has  improved,  but  I  still  get  some  intermittent\n\npain in my left lumbar region, especially after meals. It resolves on its own though.\n\nDoctor: Thats good to hear that the pain has improved. Have you had any other issues?\n\nPatient: Not really, but I did stop taking warfarin about 1.5 months ago. I was on it regularly since\n\n2017, but Dr. Tariq decided to stop it.\n\nDoctor: Okay, I see. Any signs of complications like ascites or swelling?\n\nPatient: No, I havent had any ascites since the last episode, and I feel okay otherwise.\n\n\fDoctor: Alright, so your weight is now 39 kg, still above the 25th percentile for your age. Let's check\n\nyour clinical exam. Your general examination is unremarkable, but I noticed neck swelling again. No\n\njaundice or pallor, and you have no edema.\n\nPatient: Yes, the neck swelling has been there for a while.\n\nDoctor: Your liver is slightly enlarged by 1 cm, and your spleen is 5 cm enlarged as well, but theres\n\nno ascites.\n\nPatient: Okay, so whats the next step, doctor?\n\nDoctor: Well continue with your current medications, which include:\n\nTab Propranolol 20 mg twice daily\n\nCap Evion 250 mg once daily\n\nD-Max drops 3 drops once daily\n\nTab Spironolactone 25 mg once daily\n\nFolic acid 1 tablet once daily\n\nPedia Max drops 5 drops once daily\n\nLysovit syrup 5 ml once daily\n\n\fYoull also need some further tests. Your ceruloplasmin is normal at 32, but your IgG is low at 1.61.\n\nANA is positive at 1.80, but autoimmune screening came back negative.\n\nPatient: What does all that mean?\n\nDoctor:  The  low  IgG  could  suggest  some  immune  issues,  but  well  monitor  it.  The  ANA  positivity\n\nneeds to be tracked as well, though theres no direct indication of autoimmune disease right now.\n\nPatient: I understand.\n\nDoctor: Weve scheduled an EGD for tomorrow, and your celiac screening is also in process. Were\n\ndoing a protein C and anti-thrombin test as well as some blood grouping. Youll be admitted to day\n\ncare for the EGD, and youll need to be NPO after 2 AM tonight. Ive booked an intravenous drip for\n\nyou during the procedure as well.\n\nFollow-up Visit on 29/07/2024\n\nDoctor: How have you been since your last visit?\n\nPatient: Ive been doing okay, but I had a chest pain episode on 15/06/2024. It was on the left side,\n\nand  I  had  difficulty  breathing  and  sweating.  I  went  to  a  nearby  hospital  where  they  did  an  ECG,\n\nwhich  showed  inverted  T-waves  in  leads  V2,  V3,  and  V4.  They  gave  me  aspirin,  clopidogrel,  and\n\nheparin, which helped relieve the pain.\n\nDoctor:  That  sounds  worrying.  Im  glad  you  felt  better  after  the  treatment.  Weve  also  kept  track  of\n\nyour medications, and I see youre on aspirin and glyceryl trinitrate now.\n\n\fPatient: Yes, Im taking them daily.\n\nDoctor:  Well  keep  monitoring  your  heart  and  liver  condition.  Your  weight  is  now  39  kg,  and  your\n\ngeneral  examination  remains  unremarkable.  No  jaundice,  pallor,  or  edema.  Your  liver  and  spleen\n\nare still enlarged.\n\nPatient: So, whats next?\n\nDoctor:  The  plan  includes  continuing  your  medications  and  doing  more  screenings  for  your\n\ncondition.  Well  need  to  follow  up  closely,  especially  with  your  liver  disease  and  heart  function.  Im\n\nalso reviewing your radiology and lab findings.\n\n\f",

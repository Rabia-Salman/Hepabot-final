I've had anorexia and a low-grade fever. Also, I had a\n\ncholecystectomy  on  11/11/23  and  12  sessions  of  chemotherapy  for  adenocarcinoma  of  the\n\npancreas, which I completed on 15/05/24.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI  see.  You've  had  a  biopsy  on  8/6/24,  which  showed  moderately  differentiated  adenocarcinoma  of\n\nthe  pancreatic  mass.  You  also  had  a  CT  scan  on  5/9/24,  which  showed  a  fairly  defined  lobulated\n\nmass  in  the  pancreas,  with  involvement  of  the  head,  neck,  and  uncinate  process.  The  mass  is\n\ncompressing  and  stretching  the  SMV,  and  there's  also  marked  intrahepatic  cholestasis.  I  also\n\nnoticed partial encasement of the IVC.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, that sounds like the situation. The CT also mentioned that I have some lymphadenopathy and\n\na mass at the upper abdomen.\n\nDoctor:\n\nRight. Your lab results from 6/9/24 show:\n\nTotal Bilirubin: 8\n\n\fALT: 84\n\nALP: 236\n\nIt seems you're not on any medications currently, and you dont have any significant past medical or\n\nsurgical history other than the cholecystectomy.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, thats right.\n\nDoctor:\n\nBased  on  this,  you  have  biopsy-proven  adenocarcinoma  of  the  pancreas  with  locally  advanced\n\ndisease and high bilirubin levels. Here's what we'll do:\n\nWe'll carry out all baseline investigations, including CA 19-9, which is 38.5, and schedule a triphasic\n\nCT scan.\n\nYou may need an ERCP for decompression of the biliary system.\n\nIll refer you to the ER for admission.\n\nPatient:\n\nOkay, Doctor. Thank you.\n\nFollow-up Visit (10/10/24)\n\n\fPatient:\n\nDoctor, Ive been feeling worse since my last visit. I still have jaundice and have been feeling quite\n\nnauseous with loss of appetite.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI understand. Youre a known case of biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with duodenal\n\ninfiltration. Youve completed 14 chemotherapy sessions, the last one was three months ago. How\n\nare you feeling now?\n\nPatient:\n\nIve been very tired, and I still have some mild tenderness around the PTC site. The jaundice hasn't\n\nimproved much, and I also have some drainage from the site  about 300ml in 24 hours.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI see. Let me go over your recent investigations. On 26/09/24, during the ERCP, a large, ulcerated\n\ntumor  mass  was  found  in  the  ampullary  region.  There  was  some  self-limiting  bleeding,  and\n\nunfortunately,  we  couldnt  take  a  biopsy  because  of  the  friable  mucosa.  We  will  refer  you  for\n\npercutaneous transhepatic cholangiography.\n\nPatient:\n\nThat sounds concerning.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYes, I understand. The endoscopy on 30/09/24 revealed a large, infiltrating, ulcerated mass in the\n\nduodenum.  We  took  biopsies  for  histopathology.  The  result  from  04/10/24  confirmed  poorly\n\ndifferentiated adenocarcinoma with a pancreaticobiliary origin.\n\n\fAlso, your CT scan on 24/09/24 showed a hypo-enhancing, irregularly margined mass involving the\n\npancreas,  infiltrating  the  second  and  third  parts  of  the  duodenum.  This  mass  is  abutting  major\n\nvessels like the portal vein, SMV, IVC, and GDA, and it's causing biliary dilatation.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhat does that mean for me, Doctor?\n\nDoctor:\n\nIt  suggests  locally  advanced  adenocarcinoma  of  the  pancreas  with  significant  lymphadenopathy.\n\nYour current lab results from 01/10/24 show:\n\nBilirubin: 4.48\n\nALT: 27\n\nAST: 44\n\nAlbumin: 4.0\n\nCreatinine: 0.41\n\nNa: 128\n\nK: 4.04\n\nHb: 8.7\n\n\fWBC: 12.08\n\nPlatelet: 569\n\nINR: 1.21\n\nCA 19-9: 922.6\n\nThese indicate liver involvement and elevated tumor markers.\n\nPatient:\n\nThats a lot of information. Whats the next step?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWell  discuss  your  case  in  the  multidisciplinary  team  (MDT)  meeting  tomorrow  regarding  potential\n\nresection. I will also refer you to the HPB team for a surgical review. After the MDT, well update you\n\non the treatment plan.\n\nFollow-up Visit (11/10/24)\n\nPatient:\n\nDoctor, Ive been struggling with jaundice and anorexia for the past month. Im worried about the next\n\nsteps.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYouve  had  extended  cholecystectomy  for  gallbladder  mass  on  11/11/23,  and  the  biopsy  showed\n\nwell-differentiated adenocarcinoma of biliary type. Your pancreatic adenocarcinoma is now involving\n\n\fthe duodenum. Youve had 14 chemotherapy sessions, with the last one done three months ago.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, Ive been feeling quite weak. What do the doctors think about my situation?\n\nDoctor:\n\nThe most recent findings show recurrence and residual disease involving both your gallbladder and\n\npancreas. Your lab results are still concerning:\n\nBilirubin: 4.48\n\nALT: 27\n\nAST: 44\n\nAlbumin: 4.0\n\nCreatinine: 0.41\n\nWBC: 12.08\n\nPlatelet: 569\n\nINR: 1.21\n\nCA 19-9: 922.6\n\nYour BMI is 18, indicating significant weight loss.\n\n\fPatient:\n\nWhats the next plan, Doctor?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWell proceed with a PET scan. If the disease is localized, surgery may be an option, although theres\n\na risk of recurrence. Well also continue with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\n\nPatient:\n\nThank you, Doctor. I appreciate the updates.\n\nMDT Outcome (18/10/24)\n\nClinical Coordinator:\n\nWe have discussed the patients case in the MDT. The next step is to proceed with a PET scan. The\n\noutcome  was  communicated  to  the  patient's  husband,  Ijaz  Hussain,  and  they  were  informed  by\n\nZubair Ali, Clinical Coordinator.\n\nLab Results Summary (01/10/24):\n\nBilirubin: 4.48\n\nALT: 27\n\nAST: 44\n\nAlbumin: 4.0\n\n\fCreatinine: 0.41\n\nNa: 128\n\nK: 4.04\n\nHb: 8.7\n\nWBC: 12.08\n\nPlatelet: 569\n\nINR: 1.21\n\nCA 19-9: 922.6\n\n\f",

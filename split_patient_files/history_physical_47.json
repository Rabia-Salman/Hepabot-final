What brings you in today?\n\nPatient: Actually, I dont have any active complaints at the moment.\n\nDoctor: Thats good to hear. Lets go over your medical history and recent concerns. You developed\n\nyellowing of the eyesscleral icterusabout three months ago, right?\n\nPatient: Yes. I went to Liaquat National Hospital in Karachi. They did an ERCP and placed a stent.\n\nAfter that, the jaundice resolved.\n\nDoctor:  Alright.  We  also  have  records  from  the  Sindh  Institute  of  Urology  and  Transplantation\n\nshowing  you  had  post-ERCP  pancreatitis.  Another  ERCP  was  done,  and  it  suggested  a  Klatskin\n\ntumor. Is that right?\n\nPatient: Yes, thats correct. They also did a spyglass biopsy, but I havent been able to get the report.\n\nDoctor: Understood. A liver resection was planned but couldnt be performed because the surgeon\n\nwasnt available?\n\nPatient: Yes, unfortunately.\n\n\fDoctor: You also had cholelithiasis diagnosed accidentally about three years ago, but you remained\n\nsymptom-free until recently?\n\nPatient: Thats right. I didnt have any symptoms until about three months ago.\n\nDoctor: Do you have any history of Hepatitis C or B?\n\nPatient: No history of either.\n\nDoctor:  Alright,  lets  review  some  other  symptoms.  Any  episodes  of  vomiting  blood,  abdominal\n\nswelling requiring diuretics, confusion, jaundice, or black tarry stools?\n\nPatient: None of those.\n\nDoctor: Any weight loss, fevers, or night sweats?\n\nPatient: No, none.\n\nDoctor: Have you ever had any serious illnesses, surgeries, or blood transfusions?\n\nPatient: No, nothing like that.\n\nDoctor: Are you allergic to any medications?\n\nPatient: No allergies.\n\nDoctor: What medications are you currently taking?\n\n\fPatient: Just Ursodeoxycholic acid, 250 mg, three times a day.\n\nDoctor: Got it. Lets talk a bit about your social background. Are you currently working?\n\nPatient: Yes, I work in a scrapyard.\n\nDoctor: And your highest level of education?\n\nPatient: I completed intermediate level.\n\nDoctor: Any financial strain you're dealing with?\n\nPatient: Yes, I do have financial issues.\n\nDoctor: Married?\n\nPatient: Yes, I have a wife and three children.\n\nDoctor: Any addictions?\n\nPatient: Ive been chewing betel nut for about seven years.\n\nDoctor: Family history of any major illnessesdiabetes, hypertension, cancer, TB?\n\nPatient: No, family history is unremarkable.\n\n\fDoctor: Any psychological concernsfeeling low, suicidal thoughts, anything like that?\n\nPatient: No, I feel fine mentally.\n\nDoctor: Any difficulty with speech, vision, understanding, or movement?\n\nPatient: No, Im fine in all those areas.\n\nDoctor:  On  examination,  your  central  nervous  system  is  functioning  normally,  GCS  is  15/15,  heart\n\nsounds are normal, lungs are clear, and your abdomen is soft and non-tender.\n\nLets go through the investigations.\n\nDoctor:  ERCP  on  30  July  2024  showed  a  tight  stricture  at  the  common  hepatic  duct  involving  the\n\nconfluence.  The  left  intrahepatic  duct  was  moderately  dilated,  and  the  right  duct  had  a  normal\n\ncaliber  but  couldnt  be  accessed  with  a  guide  wire.  A  sphincterotomy  was  extended,  sludge  was\n\nremoved, and a plastic stent was placed.\n\nWe will need to repeat some labs and get a CT scan with triphasic contrast. Well also need to check\n\nCA 19-9 and possibly do a repeat spyglass biopsy. Based on the current CT and MRCP, theres a\n\nsuspicion of gallbladder malignancy, hilar cholangiocarcinoma, or chronic cholecystitis. Well need to\n\nassess resectability. Ill also refer you to financial screening due to the cost implications.\n\n4 November 2024  HPB and LTX Clinic\n\nDoctor: Welcome back. We advised labs and a CT scan on your last visit. Lets review the updates.\n\nAny new complaints?\n\n\fPatient: No, Im just here for the follow-up as advised.\n\nDoctor:  Lets  re-confirm  the  history.  You  had  scleral  icterus,  underwent  ERCP  at  Liaquat  National,\n\nand the jaundice resolved. Then, you had post-ERCP pancreatitis and a repeat ERCP. A stent was\n\nplaced  again,  and  the  findings  pointed  toward  a  Klatskin  tumor.  Spyglass  biopsy  was  done,  but\n\nreport is missing.\n\nA liver resection was planned but couldnt be done due to lack of an available surgeon.\n\nCholelithiasis was incidentally diagnosed three years ago, but you had no symptoms until recently.\n\nStill no history of hepatitis B or C, and no weight loss or decompensations?\n\nPatient: Thats correct.\n\nDoctor: Great. Youre continuing ursodeoxycholic acid?\n\nPatient: Yes, 250 mg thrice daily.\n\nLets review the ERCP findings again:\n\nERCP (30/07/24): Tight stricture at common hepatic duct involving confluence. Left IHD moderately\n\ndilated;  right  IHD  normal  calibre  but  guidewire  could  not  pass.  Sphincterotomy  extended,  sludge\n\nremoved, plastic stent placed.\n\nDoctor: Your CT Scan (4/11/24) from PKLI shows mild to moderate wall thickening of the gallbladder\n\nneck, part of the body, and cystic duct. Theres enhancement abutting the common hepatic duct and\n\nmild intrahepatic biliary dilatation. These findings suggest chronic cholecystitis, although gallbladder\n\n\fmalignancy or segmental adenomyomatosis cant be ruled out completely.\n\nDoctor: Now let's look at the labs:\n\nTest(cid:9)8/8/24(cid:9)1/11/24\n\nHemoglobin(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)14.2\n\nWBC(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)6.5\n\nPlatelets(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)320\n\nTotal Bilirubin(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)0.36\n\nDirect Bilirubin(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)0.17\n\nALT/AST(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)35 / 19\n\nAlkaline Phosphatase(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)106\n\nAlbumin(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)4.66\n\nCreatinine(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)0.8\n\nSodium(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)142\n\nPotassium(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)4.55\n\nINR(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)0.89\n\nCA 19-9(cid:9)84.2(cid:9)18.48\n\nECOG(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)0\n\nBMI(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)25.01\n\nBlood Group(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)A+ve\n\nDoctor:  Based  on  this,  your  condition  has  been  discussed  in  the  MDT  (Multidisciplinary  Team).\n\nWeve explained the current situation to you and your wife.\n\nHere are the next steps:\n\nWell either remove the stent and observe to determine if the stricture is benign or malignant, or\n\n\fProceed with curative surgery if necessary.\n\n18 November 2024  HPB and LTX Clinic\n\nDoctor: Welcome back. Youre here for follow-up after the MDT discussion, correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, thats right. I dont have any current complaints.\n\nDoctor:  Let's  summarize  again.  You  developed  scleral  icterus  three  months  ago  and  underwent\n\nERCP with stent placement at Liaquat National Hospital. You had post-ERCP pancreatitis, and the\n\njaundice  returned  after  about  15  days.  A  repeat  ERCP  was  done,  the  stent  was  changed,  and\n\nKlatskin tumor was suspected.\n\nYouve  also  had  a  spyglass  biopsyreport  not  availableand  a  planned  liver  resection  that  couldnt\n\nproceed due to surgeon unavailability. Cholelithiasis was found incidentally three years ago.\n\nYouve had no history of hepatitis, no weight loss, and youre continuing ursodeoxycholic acid?\n\nPatient: Thats all correct.\n\nDoctor: Lets now go through the imaging studies:\n\nERCP  (30/07/24):  Tight  stricture  at  the  common  hepatic  duct  confluence.  Left  IHD  moderately\n\ndilated. Right IHD normal, but guide wire couldn't pass. Sludge removed, stent placed.\n\nMRCP  (03/10/24    SIUT):  Shows  cholelithiasis  without  cholecystitis,  and  a  partial  stricture  of  the\n\ncommon hepatic duct with mild CBD dilatation and stent in place.\n\n\fCT  Triphasic  (04/11/24):  Wall  thickening  of  the  gallbladder  neck,  part  of  body,  and  cystic  duct.\n\nEnhancement seen near the common hepatic duct. Mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation. Appears to be\n\nchronic cholecystitis, but gallbladder malignancy or adenomyomatosis cannot be ruled out.\n\nDoctor: Lab values remain stable and unremarkable:\n\nTest(cid:9)8/8/24(cid:9)1/11/24\n\nHemoglobin(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)14.2\n\nWBC(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)6.5\n\nPlatelets(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)320\n\nTotal Bilirubin(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)0.36\n\nDirect Bilirubin(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)0.17\n\nALT/AST(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)35 / 19\n\nAlkaline Phosphatase(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)106\n\nAlbumin(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)4.66\n\nCreatinine(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)0.8\n\nSodium(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)142\n\nPotassium(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)4.55\n\nINR(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)0.89\n\nCA 19-9(cid:9)84.2  18.48(cid:9)\n\nECOG(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)0\n\nBMI(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)25.01\n\nBlood Group(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)A+ve\n\nDoctor: The MDT discussion was held on 7/11/24. The current plan is to calculate the left lobe liver\n\nvolume and proceed based on the resectability. We will continue monitoring and possibly schedule\n\nsurgery if needed.\n\n\f",

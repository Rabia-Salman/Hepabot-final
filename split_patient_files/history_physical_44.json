I was completely fine before that.\n\nDoctor: Alright. Have you had any previous medical conditions?\n\nPatient:  Yes,  I  have  Parkinsons  disease  and  Im  taking  Sinemet  tablets  for  that.  I  also  have\n\nhypertension and diabetes.\n\nDoctor: Got it. Have you had any tests done so far?\n\nPatient: Yes. A CT scan was done recently. It showed thickened gallbladder with a mass in it, but\n\ntheres no vascular thrombosis.\n\nDoctor: Alright. Let me also check your labs. On 7th January 2025:\n\nHemoglobin: 13\n\n\fPlatelets: 522\n\nWBC: 8.15\n\nALP: 256\n\nALT: 36\n\nTotal Bilirubin: 16.5\n\nDirect Bilirubin: 14.1\n\nIndirect Bilirubin: 2.4\n\nAlbumin: 3.6\n\nCreatinine: 0.6\n\nINR: 1.3\n\nCA 19-9: 425\n\nCA 125: 12.6\n\nHepatitis B and C: Negative\n\n\fDoctor:  Have  you  experienced  any  significant  weight  loss,  vomiting  of  blood,  black  stools,  or\n\nrequired any blood transfusions?\n\nPatient: No, none of that. Just weakness and the symptoms I mentioned earlier.\n\nDoctor:  Noted.  Well  need  to  do  further  assessment.  The  MRCP  done  on  16th  December  2024\n\nshows  nodular  thickening  of  the  gallbladder  wall,  involving  the  fundus,  body,  and  cystic  duct,  with\n\ndilation of intrahepatic biliary ducts. Theres also a raised right hemidiaphragm on chest X-ray.\n\nDoctor: This is suggestive of a gallbladder mass likely causing obstructive jaundice. Ill book you for\n\nERCP  and  EUS.  Well  also  refer  you  to  a  hepatobiliary  surgeon.  The  CD  of  your  scans  will  be\n\nsubmitted for review.\n\nDate: 15 January 2025  HPB and LTX Evaluation\n\nDoctor: Let's discuss in detail. You mentioned that you were doing fine until three months ago?\n\nPatient: Yes, thats correct. I started feeling the abdominal pain and then noticed jaundice. Imaging\n\nrevealed a gallbladder mass and I was referred here.\n\nDoctor: Alright. Do you have any history of hepatitis?\n\nPatient: No. I tested negative for both HBV and HCV.\n\nDoctor: Have you had any episodes of hematemesis, ascites, or confusion?\n\nPatient: No, none of those. Just jaundice.\n\n\fDoctor: Any significant weight loss, fevers, or night sweats?\n\nPatient: No to all of those.\n\nDoctor: Have you had any previous surgeries?\n\nPatient: Yes, I had LCSC about 25 years ago.\n\nDoctor: Any allergies?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nDoctor: What medications are you currently taking?\n\nPatient: Im taking:\n\nDomperidone 10 mg, three times a day\n\nOmeprazole 40 mg, once a day\n\nGlucerna powder, 20 g, three times a day\n\nSinemet tablet, once daily\n\nDoctor: Any addictions?\n\n\fPatient: No, none at all.\n\nDoctor: Whats your family history like?\n\nPatient: Unremarkableno known cancers, TB, diabetes, or asthma.\n\nDoctor: Do you face any financial issues?\n\nPatient: Yes, we are under financial strain.\n\nDoctor: Are you educated?\n\nPatient: No, Im uneducated. Im a housewife and married.\n\nDoctor: Alright. On examination today:\n\nCNS: Youre conscious and oriented, GCS 15/15\n\nCVS: Normal heart sounds\n\nRespiratory: Clear vesicular breathing\n\nAbdomen: Soft, non-tender, not distended\n\nDoctor: Lets go over your scans again:\n\nUSG on 9 December 2024: Thick-walled, collapsed gallbladder with a 23 mm lesion\n\n\fCT  Scan  on  7  January  2025:  Enlarged  liver,  circumferential  enhancing  wall  thickness  in  the\n\ngallbladder fundus, distended GB body, no stones, mild thickening of biliary ducts, CBD 3.3 mm, no\n\nlymph nodes, pancreas normal\n\nMRCP on 16 December 2024: Nodular GB wall thickening, intrahepatic biliary dilation suggestive of\n\nmalignancy\n\nDoctor: Lab summary from 7 Jan 2025:\n\nHb: 13.1\n\nWBC: 8.15\n\nPlatelets: 522\n\nBilirubin (Total/Direct): 16.5 / 14.1\n\nALT: 36\n\nALP: 256\n\nAlbumin: 3.6\n\nCreatinine: 0.6\n\nSodium: 131\n\n\fPotassium: 4.1\n\nINR: 1.3\n\nCA 125: 12.8\n\nDoctor: The assessment suggests likely carcinoma of the gallbladder. Well:\n\nReview your CT if uploaded properly\n\nGet tumor markers\n\nDo a CT chest if not already done\n\nReview again in clinic once results are in\n\nDate: 16 January 2025  Follow-Up\n\nDoctor: Were still waiting on the CT report from PKLI and the CA 19-9 level.\n\nDoctor: Previously, your CT showed:\n\nLiver enlargement\n\nThickened gallbladder wall in the fundus\n\n\fCollapsed lumen, no stones\n\nMild thickening of bile ducts\n\nNo lymphadenopathy\n\nNormal pancreas\n\nDoctor: MRCP also shows concern for gallbladder malignancy.\n\nDoctor: Lab results from 7 Jan 2025 still hold:\n\nCA 125: 12.8\n\nCA 19-9: Awaiting\n\nDoctor: You were seen in OPD by our team. CT was uploaded but arterial phase is missing, so were\n\ngetting a fresh CT triphasic today. Follow-up in the afternoon after the scan.\n\nDate: 17 January 2025  Post Triphasic CT\n\nDoctor: We reviewed the triphasic CT liver with HCC protocol done today. It shows:\n\nThickening of the right-sided ducts up to the CBD\n\nSmooth enhancing thickened gallbladder wall\n\n\fEnhancement and thickening of CHD and CBD\n\nMild intrahepatic biliary dilatation\n\nNo obvious metastatic disease\n\nDoctor: This is likely a malignant lesion involving the right ductal system.\n\nDoctor: The surgical plan includes:\n\nStandard right hepatectomy with caudate lobe excision\n\nRoux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy\n\nFrozen section and assessment of distal CBD\n\nDoctor: But your bilirubin is currently too high for surgery.\n\nDoctor: Well refer you to hepatology for ERCP and stenting of the left hepatic duct to drain the left\n\nbiliary system. This should help improve cholestasis.\n\nDoctor: Ill ask our coordinator, Zubair, to schedule surgery after the ERCP and stenting.\n\nDoctor: Just to inform you, the mortality risk is around 5%, and morbidity is about 1520%. Theres a\n\n3040% chance of recurrence. Weve explained all this in detail.\n\nDate: 20 January 2025  Hepatology Clinic\n\n\fDoctor: Youve been referred from HPB for ERCP. Based on your current presentation:\n\nYou have obstructive jaundice due to a malignant lesion in the right ductal system.\n\nYour CA 19-9 is now more than 1000.\n\nDoctor: CT Triphasic findings from 17 Jan confirm:\n\nThickened right-sided ducts up to CBD\n\nIntrahepatic biliary dilatation\n\nThickened enhancing gallbladder wall\n\nNo signs of metastasis\n\nDoctor: MRCP on 16 Dec also points to gallbladder malignancy.\n\nDoctor: Lab results on 15 Jan:\n\nHb: 13.1\n\nWBC: 8.15\n\nPlatelets: 522\n\n\fTotal Bilirubin: 16.5\n\nDirect Bilirubin: 14.1\n\nALT: 36\n\nALP: 256\n\nAlbumin: 3.6\n\nCreatinine: 0.6\n\nSodium: 131\n\nPotassium: 4.1\n\nINR: 1.3\n\nCA 125: 12.8\n\nCA 19-9: >1000\n\nDoctor:  The  next  step  is  to  proceed  with  ERCP  and  stenting  of  the  left  hepatic  duct  to  improve\n\ndrainage and prepare you for surgery.\n\n\f",

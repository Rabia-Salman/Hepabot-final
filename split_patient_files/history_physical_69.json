    "raw_text": "Gender: Female\n\nAge: 43\n\nMRN: 832187\n\nDiagnosis: Hepatocellular Carcinoma\n\nHistory and Physical:\n\nDoctor:\n\nHello,  I  see  youve  been  experiencing  fever,  nausea,  and  vomiting  for  the  past  20  days,  and\n\nabdominal pain developed shortly after that. Youve received some treatment from a local hospital, is\n\nthat right?\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, thats correct. I had those symptoms, and I took medication from the local hospital. But it didnt\n\nseem to improve much.\n\nDoctor:\n\nAlright, Ill review your history. You were feeling fine around 30 days ago, but then these symptoms\n\nstarted.  You  had  an  ultrasound  of  your  abdomen  which  showed  a  hepatic  nodule  and  a  dilated\n\nportal vein. We also did some tests for Hepatitis C and B. Your Hepatitis C test came back negative,\n\nand though one of your reports showed Hepatitis B as positive, the latest PCR test for Hepatitis B\n\nfrom Aga Khan showed \"not detected.\" Have you been on any treatment for these conditions?\n\nPatient:\n\nNo, I havent been on any treatment before.\n\nDoctor:\n\nUnderstood. Lets move on to your review of symptoms. You have not had hematemesis, ascites, or\n\njaundice, which are good signs. Theres no history of significant weight loss, and you haven't needed\n\n\fblood transfusions. Also, no fever or night sweats, correct?\n\nPatient:\n\nThats right. I havent had any of those symptoms.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThats  reassuring.  Now,  Im  going  to  review  your  past  medical  and  surgical  history.  Youve  had  a\n\nhysterectomy two years ago, but there are no other significant medical issues or allergies.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, the hysterectomy was two years ago. No other health issues.\n\nDoctor:\n\nAlright. Lets move on to your family history. You mentioned that you have a history of diabetes and\n\nhypertension in your family. Is that correct?\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, both my parents had diabetes and hypertension.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThanks for sharing that. Now, regarding your social and psychological history, it looks like theres no\n\nhistory  of  depression,  suicidal  thoughts,  or  self-harm.  Youre  a  housewife  and  have  one  daughter.\n\nYou  do  not  have  any  addictions  to  smoking,  alcohol,  or  other  substances.  There  are  also  no\n\nreligious or cultural needs we need to consider, and no financial or educational issues reported.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, thats correct.\n\n\fDoctor:\n\nOn your physical exam, youre conscious and well-oriented with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15. Your\n\nheart  sounds  are  normal,  and  theres  no  tenderness  or  distention  in  your  abdomen.  Now,  let's  go\n\nover your investigations. Your ultrasound on 4th September showed a hepatic nodule, coarse liver,\n\nand dilated portal vein. We did a CT scan on 7th September, and it showed an ill-defined lesion in\n\nyour left hepatic lobe. The lesion was 5.8 x 4.7 x 5.9 cm, with peripheral enhancement and a central\n\nnecrotic  component.  There  was  also  a  hepatic  cyst  and  some  small  abdominal  and  mediastinal\n\nlymphadenopathy, but no pulmonary or osseous metastases.\n\nPatient:\n\nThat sounds serious. What does it mean?\n\nDoctor:\n\nIt  indicates  a  significant  abnormality  in  the  liver,  and  based  on  your  biopsy  results  from  21st\n\nSeptember,  the  lesion  is  a  poorly  differentiated  carcinoma,  which  means  its  a  type  of  cancer.  We\n\nalso performed lab tests, and your MELD score is 6, which indicates a relatively better liver function.\n\nYour AFP levels were normal, but we will continue monitoring them closely.\n\nPatient:\n\nI see. Whats the next step?\n\nDoctor:\n\nYour case was discussed in the multidisciplinary team meeting on 15th October. Given the lesions\n\nlocation and size, were considering a left lateral segmentectomy, which is a surgery to remove part\n\nof the liver. We will need to do more tests, such as blood group and serum electrolytes, and review\n\nthe CT scan from PKLI.\n\n\fPatient:\n\nOkay, I understand. What should I do now?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWe  will  proceed  with  the  necessary  tests,  and  once  the  team  meets  again,  we  will  have  a  clearer\n\nplan. Please follow up after the MDT discussion.\n\nFollow-up Visit (21st October 2024)\n\nDoctor:\n\nGood to see you back. How have you been feeling since our last visit?\n\nPatient:\n\nIve been alright, no major issues, but I still have some pain in my abdomen.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI  see.  Your  recent  tests,  including  your  ultrasound,  show  that  the  liver  lesion  is  still  present,  and\n\ntheres some collection of fluid near the surgical site. The histopathology report confirmed invasive\n\ncarcinoma at the margin of the tumor. Your tumor has a size of 6.4 x 4.2 cm, and its classified as\n\npT1b, which means its a solitary tumor without vascular invasion.\n\nPatient:\n\nSo, what does this mean for my treatment?\n\nDoctor:\n\nGiven that the tumor was found at the margin and is invasive, were going to start chemotherapy with\n\n\fSorafenib.  Youll  need  to  take  200  mg  twice  a  day.  Im  also  prescribing  some  medications  for  your\n\ngeneral  health,  like  Surbex  and  Omeprazole  for  any  acidity.  Youll  also  need  Ispaghol  husk  for\n\nconstipation.\n\nPatient:\n\nI understand. When do I start the chemotherapy?\n\nDoctor:\n\nYou should start the chemotherapy a week after this visit. We will closely monitor your progress, and\n\nI want you to follow up after you begin the treatment.\n\nFollow-up Visit After Surgery (29th November 2024)\n\nDoctor:\n\nHow are you feeling today?\n\nPatient:\n\nI have some pain in my right leg and at the surgical site.\n\nDoctor:\n\nOn examination, your wound is healing well, and the staples have been removed. Your ultrasound\n\nshows some fluid collection at the surgical site, but it's being partially organized, which is expected\n\nafter surgery. We also noted some pleural effusion on the left side, but it's not alarming at this stage.\n\nPatient:\n\nI see. Is that normal after surgery?\n\n\fDoctor:\n\nYes,  thats  quite  common.  Regarding  your  histopathology  report,  it  confirms  that  theres  invasive\n\ncarcinoma  at  the  margin  of  the  liver  tumor,  but  its  still  in  the  early  stages,  classified  as  pT1b  with\n\ngrade  G2.  That  means  were  dealing  with  a  manageable  situation,  but  we  need  to  proceed  with\n\nchemotherapy to ensure it doesn't progress.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhat will happen next?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWe  will  begin  the  chemotherapy  with  Sorafenib  as  planned,  and  Ill  continue  to  monitor  your  lab\n\nresults  closely.  Your  next  steps  will  include  regular  follow-ups  and  any  necessary  adjustments  to\n\nyour treatment based on how you're responding.\n\nLab Results (28th November 2024):\n\nTotal-BILI: 0.25\n\nDirect-BILI: 0.09\n\nALT/AST: 27/29\n\nAlk. Phos.: 100\n\nAlbumin: 4.26\n\nCreatinine: 0.78\n\n\fNa+: 139\n\nK+: 4.33\n\nINR: -\n\nDoctor:\n\nYour lab results are improving, and well continue to monitor your liver function closely. Keep up with\n\nthe prescribed medications, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns.\n\nPatient:\n\nThank you, doctor. Ill follow the treatment plan and let you know if anything changes.\n\n\f",

How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient:\n\nGood morning, doctor. I'm feeling okay, but Ive had some nausea and vomiting for the past month,\n\nand my back has been hurting a bit.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI see. Let's start by looking at your general health status. How is your weight?\n\nPatient:\n\nI weigh around 20kg now.\n\nDoctor:\n\nAlright, let's go over some of your previous medical history. Youve been diagnosed with Budd-Chiari\n\nSyndrome. Could you remind me about when you were first diagnosed and how things have been\n\nsince?\n\nPatient:\n\nI was diagnosed back in November 2017. I had abdominal distention and loose stools, so I went to\n\nServices Hospital where they did several tests. They diagnosed me with venous-occlusive disease,\n\nand  I  was  referred  to  CHL  for  Budd-Chiari  Syndrome.  I  also  had  an  ascitic  tap  done  there  and\n\n\fneeded a blood transfusion. Since then, Ive been on follow-up at CHL. Theyve done three EGDs,\n\nand I havent had any issues like jaundice, hematemesis, melena, or encephalopathy.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThank  you  for  updating  me.  Let's  go  over  your  current  medications.  You're  on  Aldactone,  Inderal,\n\nOra AD drops, and K Lot injections, correct?\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, that's right.\n\nDoctor:\n\nGood. Well make sure to keep track of how your body is responding to these treatments. Now, let's\n\nlook at your recent lab results.\n\nHere are the results from 06.06.23:\n\nBilirubin: 1.96\n\nALT: 28\n\nAST: 27\n\nALP: 230\n\nGGT: 62\n\nAlbumin: 4.29\n\n\fUrea: 17\n\nCreatinine: 0.38\n\nSodium (Na): 131\n\nPotassium (K): 4.9\n\nChloride (Cl): 96.1\n\nWBC: 6.8\n\nHemoglobin (Hb): 10\n\nPlatelets (PLT): 392\n\nINR: 1.6\n\nProtein C: 34 (low)\n\nAnti-HEV IgG: Negative\n\nAnti-HEV IgM: Negative\n\nAnti-HAV IgM: Negative\n\n\fHBsAg: Non-reactive\n\nAnti-HCV: Borderline (1.26)\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, those results are from my recent tests. Is there anything unusual about them?\n\nDoctor:\n\nThe  low  Protein  C  level  is  concerning  and  something  we  need  to  monitor.  Also,  your  INR  is  a  bit\n\nelevated, so we should keep an eye on that. Your liver function tests like ALT, AST, and albumin are\n\nshowing stable results, which is good.\n\nPatient:\n\nOkay, that sounds good to hear.\n\nDoctor:\n\nLets  also  discuss  your  latest  imaging  results.  Your  CT  scan  from  09.06.23  showed  changes\n\nconsistent with chronic liver disease and mild pelvic ascites. It also mentioned the non-visualization\n\nof the hepatic veins, which is typical for Budd-Chiari Syndrome.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes,  I  remember  that  from  the  report.  They  said  the  hepatic  veins  werent  visible,  and  it  showed\n\nsome changes in the liver.\n\nDoctor:\n\nCorrect.  The  EGD  you  had  on  13.06.23  showed  grade  III  esophageal  varices  with  red  signs,  and\n\nthey  placed  two  bands  for  treatment.  Youve  had  these  varices  for  some  time,  and  well  need  to\n\n\fcontinue monitoring them closely.\n\nPatient:\n\nHow often will I need to have these monitored?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWell  need  to  do  regular  surveillance  EGDs.  The  next  one  is  scheduled  for  tomorrow,  and  well\n\nreassess  after  that.  In  the  meantime,  weve  started  you  on  Furosemide  to  help  with  fluid  retention\n\nand manage your ascites. Well also check your vitamin D levels and repeat some labs.\n\nPatient:\n\nAlright, thank you for the plan, doctor. I also wanted to ask about the vaccinations. Do I need any\n\nvaccines?\n\nDoctor:\n\nYes, well be administering the Hepatitis A vaccine soon. Its important to make sure youre protected\n\nagainst that.\n\nPatient:\n\nGot it, doctor. Whats next in terms of the treatment plan?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWell continue with your current medications and focus on managing your symptoms. We may need\n\nto discuss your case further in a multidisciplinary team meeting once the ascites resolves. Well also\n\nbe following up on your lab results closely.\n\nPatient:\n\n\fThank you for the care and attention, doctor. I feel reassured.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYou're welcome, Mateen. Well take it one step at a time. See you tomorrow for your EGD, and well\n\ngo from there.\n\nDoctor:\n\nGood morning, Mateen. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient:\n\nGood morning, doctor.

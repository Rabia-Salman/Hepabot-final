Ive  been  having  a  few  issues  lately,  and  I  wanted  to  get  them\n\nchecked out. My son, Aamir, brought me here today. Hes doing a PhD in Biochemistry and has all\n\nthe necessary documents with him.\n\nDoctor:  Good  morning!  I  understand  you're  dealing  with  a  few  concerns.  Can  you  please  tell  me\n\nmore about your symptoms?\n\nPatient:  Yes,  Ive  been  experiencing  significant  weight  loss,  about  12  to  15  kilograms,  but  I  didnt\n\ntrack it properly. Im also having trouble sleeping, and Ive lost my appetite. Recently, Ive also been\n\nfeeling some pain in my chest, right in the middle.\n\nDoctor: That sounds concerning. Have you had any fevers or night sweats?\n\nPatient: No, I havent had any fevers or night sweats.\n\nDoctor: Good to know. Any issues with physical or cognitive limitations?\n\nPatient: No, I dont have any physical or cognitive limitations.\n\nDoctor:  Alright,  lets  review  your  medical  history.  I  see  that  you  have  diabetes,  but  its  been\n\nuncontrolled. You also have a history of APD and underwent an open appendectomy back in 1980.\n\nDo you have any allergies?\n\n\fPatient: No allergies that I know of.\n\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. Lets discuss your lifestyle. You live with your family in Mirpur,\n\nAJK, and have a BA degree. You used to work as a shopkeeper, but youre not working now. Are\n\nyou smoking or consuming alcohol?\n\nPatient: I used to smoke, but I quit about seven years ago. I dont drink alcohol.\n\nDoctor:  Got  it.  Now,  lets  talk  about  the  recent  investigations.  You  had  an  OGD  on  February  10th,\n\nand  it  showed  normal  CBD,  but  two  lymph  nodes  at  the  porta  hepatis,  with  the  largest  one\n\nmeasuring 1.3 x 1.4 cm. The biopsy taken from the periportal lymph node showed no malignancy.\n\nThats a good sign.\n\nPatient: Yes, the biopsy didnt show anything concerning.\n\nDoctor:  Your  CT  scan  from  February  7th  showed  mild  hepatomegaly  and  a  subtle  enhancing  soft\n\ntissue  fullness  at  the  confluence  of  the  right  and  left  hepatic  ducts,  with  some  mild  to  moderate\n\nintrahepatic  bile  duct  dilation  and  a  thrombosed  left  portal  vein.  Some  prominent  upper  abdominal\n\nnodes were also noted, and the imaging suggested cholangiocarcinoma.\n\nPatient: Thats a bit alarming. What does this mean for me?\n\nDoctor:  We  need  to  take  a  closer  look  at  your  liver  and  bile  ducts.  Youve  been  diagnosed  with\n\nlocally advanced cholangiocarcinoma. The right posterior artery appears to be involved, and theres\n\nmild narrowing of the main portal vein. We also see some changes in your liver's left lobe.\n\n\fPatient: What does this mean for treatment?\n\nDoctor:  Let  me  walk  you  through  the  plan.  Ill  order  a  fresh  CT  scan  from  PKLI  to  get  updated\n\nimaging.  After  that,  well  bring  you  into  the  multidisciplinary  team  (MDT)  for  further  discussion.  We\n\nwill also meet with our coordinator, Asif, to facilitate your follow-up and any necessary support.\n\nPatient: Okay, I understand. What about my current medication?\n\nDoctor: You dont have any major issues with your current meds. Lets wait until we get the updated\n\nscan before making any adjustments.\n\nPatient: Thank you for explaining, doctor. Its a lot to process, but I appreciate your help.\n\nDoctor: You're welcome. We'll be here to guide you through this. Let's take it step by step.\n\nDoctor: Good to see you again. Based on the recent evaluation, your diagnosis of locally advanced\n\ncholangiocarcinoma still stands. Unfortunately, you're not a candidate for surgery due to the extent\n\nof the disease.\n\nPatient: Thats disappointing, doctor. Whats next for me?\n\nDoctor: I understand how you feel. The next step is an ERCP with a spyglass to evaluate your bile\n\nducts further and obtain a biopsy. After that, well refer you to oncology for a definite diagnosis and\n\ntreatment options as per the MDTs decision.\n\nPatient: What about my current medication?\n\n\fDoctor:  You  can  stop  taking  urso  for  now,  as  its  not  beneficial  given  your  current  condition.  Well\n\nreassess everything once we have the biopsy results.\n\nPatient: Alright, I will follow your advice. Thank you for your guidance.\n\nDoctor:  You're  welcome.  Well  keep  you  informed  and  make  sure  youre  supported  throughout  this\n\njourney.\n\n\f",

What brings you in today?\n\nPatient: Actually, I dont have any active complaints at the moment.\n\nDoctor: Thats good to hear. Lets go over your medical history and recent concerns. You developed\n\nyellowing of the eyesscleral icterusabout three months ago, right?\n\nPatient: Yes. I went to Liaquat National Hospital in Karachi. They did an ERCP and placed a stent.\n\nAfter that, the jaundice resolved.\n\nDoctor:  Alright.  We  also  have  records  from  the  Sindh  Institute  of  Urology  and  Transplantation\n\nshowing  you  had  post-ERCP  pancreatitis.  Another  ERCP  was  done,  and  it  suggested  a  Klatskin\n\ntumor. Is that right?\n\nPatient: Yes, thats correct. They also did a spyglass biopsy, but I havent been able to get the report.\n\nDoctor: Understood. A liver resection was planned but couldnt be performed because the surgeon\n\nwasnt available?\n\nPatient: Yes, unfortunately.\n\n\fDoctor: You also had cholelithiasis diagnosed accidentally about three years ago, but you remained\n\nsymptom-free until recently?\n\nPatient: Thats right. I didnt have any symptoms until about three months ago.\n\nDoctor: Do you have any history of Hepatitis C or B?\n\nPatient: No history of either.\n\nDoctor:  Alright,  lets  review  some  other  symptoms.  Any  episodes  of  vomiting  blood,  abdominal\n\nswelling requiring diuretics, confusion, jaundice, or black tarry stools?\n\nPatient: None of those.\n\nDoctor: Any weight loss, fevers, or night sweats?\n\nPatient: No, none.\n\nDoctor: Have you ever had any serious illnesses, surgeries, or blood transfusions?\n\nPatient: No, nothing like that.\n\nDoctor: Are you allergic to any medications?\n\nPatient: No allergies.\n\nDoctor: What medications are you currently taking?\n\n\fPatient: Just Ursodeoxycholic acid, 250 mg, three times a day.\n\nDoctor: Got it. Lets talk a bit about your social background. Are you currently working?\n\nPatient: Yes, I work in a scrapyard.\n\nDoctor: And your highest level of education?\n\nPatient: I completed intermediate level.\n\nDoctor: Any financial strain you're dealing with?\n\nPatient: Yes, I do have financial issues.\n\nDoctor: Married?\n\nPatient: Yes, I have a wife and three children.\n\nDoctor: Any addictions?\n\nPatient: Ive been chewing betel nut for about seven years.\n\nDoctor: Family history of any major illnessesdiabetes, hypertension, cancer, TB?\n\nPatient: No, family history is unremarkable.\n\n\fDoctor: Any psychological concernsfeeling low, suicidal thoughts, anything like that?\n\nPatient: No, I feel fine mentally.\n\nDoctor: Any difficulty with speech, vision, understanding, or movement?\n\nPatient: No, Im fine in all those areas.\n\nDoctor:  On  examination,  your  central  nervous  system  is  functioning  normally,  GCS  is  15/15,  heart\n\nsounds are normal, lungs are clear, and your abdomen is soft and non-tender.\n\nLets go through the investigations.\n\nDoctor:  ERCP  on  30  July  2024  showed  a  tight  stricture  at  the  common  hepatic  duct  involving  the\n\nconfluence.  The  left  intrahepatic  duct  was  moderately  dilated,  and  the  right  duct  had  a  normal\n\ncaliber  but  couldnt  be  accessed  with  a  guide  wire.  A  sphincterotomy  was  extended,  sludge  was\n\nremoved, and a plastic stent was placed.\n\nWe will need to repeat some labs and get a CT scan with triphasic contrast. Well also need to check\n\nCA 19-9 and possibly do a repeat spyglass biopsy. Based on the current CT and MRCP, theres a\n\nsuspicion of gallbladder malignancy, hilar cholangiocarcinoma, or chronic cholecystitis. Well need to\n\nassess resectability. Ill also refer you to financial screening due to the cost implications.\n\n4 November 2024  HPB and LTX Clinic\n\nDoctor: Welcome back. We advised labs and a CT scan on your last visit. Lets review the updates.\n\nAny new complaints?\n\n\fPatient: No, Im just here for the follow-up as advised.\n\nDoctor:  Lets  re-confirm  the  history.  You  had  scleral  icterus,  underwent  ERCP  at  Liaquat  National,\n\nand the jaundice resolved. Then, you had post-ERCP pancreatitis and a repeat ERCP. A stent was\n\nplaced  again,  and  the  findings  pointed  toward  a  Klatskin  tumor.  Spyglass  biopsy  was  done,  but\n\nreport is missing.\n\nA liver resection was planned but couldnt be done due to lack of an available surgeon.\n\nCholelithiasis was incidentally diagnosed three years ago, but you had no symptoms until recently.\n\nStill no history of hepatitis B or C, and no weight loss or decompensations?\n\nPatient: Thats correct.\n\nDoctor: Great. Youre continuing ursodeoxycholic acid?\n\nPatient: Yes, 250 mg thrice daily.\n\nLets review the ERCP findings again:\n\nERCP (30/07/24): Tight stricture at common hepatic duct involving confluence. Left IHD moderately\n\ndilated;  right  IHD  normal  calibre  but  guidewire  could  not  pass.  Sphincterotomy  extended,  sludge\n\nremoved, plastic stent placed.\n\nDoctor: Your CT Scan (4/11/24) from PKLI shows mild to moderate wall thickening of the gallbladder\n\nneck, part of the body, and cystic duct. Theres enhancement abutting the common hepatic duct and\n\nmild intrahepatic biliary dilatation. These findings suggest chronic cholecystitis, although gallbladder\n\n\fmalignancy or segmental adenomyomatosis cant be ruled out completely.\n\nDoctor: Now let's look at the labs:\n\nTest(cid:9)8/8/24(cid:9)1/11/24\n\nHemoglobin(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)14.2\n\nWBC(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)6.5\n\nPlatelets(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)320\n\nTotal Bilirubin(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)0.36\n\nDirect Bilirubin(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)0.17\n\nALT/AST(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)35 / 19\n\nAlkaline Phosphatase(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)106\n\nAlbumin(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)4.66\n\nCreatinine(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)0.8\n\nSodium(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)142\n\nPotassium(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)4.55\n\nINR(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)0.89\n\nCA 19-9(cid:9)84.2(cid:9)18.48\n\nECOG(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)0\n\nBMI(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)25.01\n\nBlood Group(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)A+ve\n\nDoctor:  Based  on  this,  your  condition  has  been  discussed  in  the  MDT  (Multidisciplinary  Team).\n\nWeve explained the current situation to you and your wife.\n\nHere are the next steps:\n\nWell either remove the stent and observe to determine if the stricture is benign or malignant, or\n\n\fProceed with curative surgery if necessary.\n\n18 November 2024  HPB and LTX Clinic\n\nDoctor: Welcome back. Youre here for follow-up after the MDT discussion, correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, thats right. I dont have any current complaints.\n\nDoctor:  Let's  summarize  again.  You  developed  scleral  icterus  three  months  ago  and  underwent\n\nERCP with stent placement at Liaquat National Hospital. You had post-ERCP pancreatitis, and the\n\njaundice  returned  after  about  15  days.  A  repeat  ERCP  was  done,  the  stent  was  changed,  and\n\nKlatskin tumor was suspected.\n\nYouve  also  had  a  spyglass  biopsyreport  not  availableand  a  planned  liver  resection  that  couldnt\n\nproceed due to surgeon unavailability. Cholelithiasis was found incidentally three years ago.\n\nYouve had no history of hepatitis, no weight loss, and youre continuing ursodeoxycholic acid?\n\nPatient: Thats all correct.\n\nDoctor: Lets now go through the imaging studies:\n\nERCP  (30/07/24):  Tight  stricture  at  the  common  hepatic  duct  confluence.  Left  IHD  moderately\n\ndilated. Right IHD normal, but guide wire couldn't pass. Sludge removed, stent placed.\n\nMRCP  (03/10/24    SIUT):  Shows  cholelithiasis  without  cholecystitis,  and  a  partial  stricture  of  the\n\ncommon hepatic duct with mild CBD dilatation and stent in place.\n\n\fCT  Triphasic  (04/11/24):  Wall  thickening  of  the  gallbladder  neck,  part  of  body,  and  cystic  duct.\n\nEnhancement seen near the common hepatic duct. Mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation. Appears to be\n\nchronic cholecystitis, but gallbladder malignancy or adenomyomatosis cannot be ruled out.\n\nDoctor: Lab values remain stable and unremarkable:\n\nTest(cid:9)8/8/24(cid:9)1/11/24\n\nHemoglobin(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)14.2\n\nWBC(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)6.5\n\nPlatelets(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)320\n\nTotal Bilirubin(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)0.36\n\nDirect Bilirubin(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)0.17\n\nALT/AST(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)35 / 19\n\nAlkaline Phosphatase(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)106\n\nAlbumin(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)4.66\n\nCreatinine(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)0.8\n\nSodium(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)142\n\nPotassium(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)4.55\n\nINR(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)0.89\n\nCA 19-9(cid:9)84.2  18.48(cid:9)\n\nECOG(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)0\n\nBMI(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)25.01\n\nBlood Group(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)A+ve\n\nDoctor: The MDT discussion was held on 7/11/24. The current plan is to calculate the left lobe liver\n\nvolume and proceed based on the resectability. We will continue monitoring and possibly schedule\n\nsurgery if needed.\n\n\f",

How's  your  appetite  and\n\nenergy?\n\nPatient: Appetite is okay but I do feel a bit weak. The discomfort is mostly around my upper belly.\n\nDoctor: That would be the epigastric region, correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, exactly there.\n\nDoctor: Understood. Let's go over some of your history to keep everything in perspective. You had\n\nH. pylori gastritis which caused a peptic ulcer and melena about a year ago, right?\n\nPatient: Yes, thats correct.\n\nDoctor: And you had a laparotomy about 30 years ago for volvulus?\n\nPatient: Yes, I had that surgery a long time ago. No issues since then.\n\n\fDoctor: Any family or social history we need to be aware of?\n\nPatient: No, nothing significant. No allergies either.\n\nDoctor: Alright. On examination, your wound is healthy and healing well. Your ultrasound abdomen\n\nfrom 23rd January shows:\n\nStatus post left hepatectomy.\n\nNo significant abdominal collection.\n\nOverall, its an unremarkable scan, which is good news.\n\nNow lets review your lab results:\n\nDate(cid:9)Hb(cid:9)WBC(cid:9)PLT(cid:9)T.

Your  hemoglobin  improved,  liver  enzymes  normalized  significantly,\n\nand your bilirubin levels dropped  thats very positive. No concerns from our side at the moment.\n\nPatient: Thats a relief to hear.\n\nDoctor: Great. Well go ahead and remove your urostomy bag now. Please come for follow-up in two\n\nweeks with repeat LFTs and CBC. We'll also review your histopathology report at that time.\n\n(cid:9)\n(cid:9)\n(cid:9)\n(cid:9)\n(cid:9)\n(cid:9)\n(cid:9)\n(cid:9)\n(cid:9)\n(cid:9)\n\fPost-operative Visit 2  POD 25 (10/02/25)\n\nDoctor: Welcome back. How have you been since our last visit?\n\nPatient: I've been struggling a bit with insomnia again. I used to take Escitalopram 5 mg once daily\n\nfor this.\n\nDoctor: Understood. Anything else?\n\nPatient: I feel generalized weakness and Ive lost my appetite.\n\nDoctor: Got it. Did anything new happen over the last couple of weeks?\n\nPatient: Yes, I had a urinary tract infection about a week ago. It was managed conservatively and it's\n\nsettled now.\n\nDoctor: Alright. On examination, your abdomen is soft, and your wound is completely healed. Lets\n\ngo over your final histopathology report in detail:\n\nDiagnosis:  Intrahepatic  cholangiocarcinoma  (mixed  large  and  small  duct  type),  moderately\n\ndifferentiated, Grade 2.\n\nSize: 11 cm tumor.\n\nPathological  Stage:  pT1b,  pN0,  pMx    meaning  it's  limited  to  the  liver,  no  nodal  or  distant  spread\n\nevident.\n\nMargins:\n\n\fLiver parenchymal margin: Involved by tumor.\n\nAll other margins (capsular, hilar soft tissue, hepatic duct, artery, portal vein): Uninvolved, 0.10.6 cm\n\naway from tumor.\n\nLymph Nodes:\n\n10 nodes reactive and free of tumor.\n\nGallbladder: Chronic cholecystitis, no tumor.\n\nOther excised tissues: No malignancy seen.\n\nPatient: What does it mean that the liver margin is involved?\n\nDoctor:  That  indicates  the  tumor  reached  the  cut  edge  of  the  liver,  which  increases  the  risk  of\n\nrecurrence. We will need to monitor this closely and involve oncology for further management.\n\nLet me summarize the additional lymph node findings:\n\nRight periportal, common hepatic artery, cystic artery, and falciform ligament lymph nodes  all were\n\nreactive and free of tumor, with no granulomas or malignancy.\n\nPatient: Okay, I understand.

I  developed  yellowing  of  my  eyes,  my\n\nstools  became  pale,  and  my  urine  turned  dark.  Along  with  that,  I  have  been  experiencing\n\ngeneralized itching.\n\nDoctor: I see. How long have these symptoms been ongoing?\n\nPatient: It started around four months ago, and things have gotten progressively worse since then.\n\nAbout a month ago, I had jaundice, and my bilirubin levels were very higharound 54.5.\n\nDoctor:  It  seems  like  your  jaundice  has  been  persistent.  You  mentioned  that  you  underwent  an\n\nERCP during this time?\n\nPatient:  Yes,  I  did.  Unfortunately,  the  procedure  didnt  go  well.  It  was  abandoned  because  they\n\ncouldnt fix the issue. After that, I was admitted to the hospital for PTBD, which was performed at the\n\nMilitary Hospital. However, after the procedure, I had complications, including an upper GI bleed. I\n\nwas then referred for angioplasty and embolization of the gastroduodenal artery.\n\nDoctor: That sounds like a challenging few weeks. How long were you hospitalized?\n\nPatient: I was hospitalized from July 18th to August 6th.\n\nDoctor:  Understood.  Lets  go  over  some  of  your  other  symptoms.  Have  you  experienced  any\n\n\fhematemesis  (vomiting  blood),  ascites  (fluid  buildup  in  the  abdomen),  or  any  episodes  of  hepatic\n\nencephalopathy (confusion due to liver failure)?\n\nPatient: No, I havent had any vomiting blood, ascites, or confusion. The only thing Ive been dealing\n\nwith is jaundice.\n\nDoctor: Good to know. Have you had any significant weight loss recently?\n\nPatient: Yes, Ive lost about 15 kilograms over the past four months.\n\nDoctor: Thats quite significant. Have you had any blood transfusions due to this weight loss?\n\nPatient: Yes, I had 5 pints of blood transfused because of my low hemoglobin levels.\n\nDoctor: Were you experiencing any fevers or night sweats?\n\nPatient: No, I havent had any fevers or night sweats.\n\nDoctor: Alright, let's move on to your past medical and surgical history. Do you have any history of\n\nmajor health conditions or surgeries?\n\nPatient: No, I havent had any significant medical issues or surgeries in the past.\n\nDoctor: Thats helpful to know. Do you have any known allergies?\n\nPatient: No, I dont have any allergies.\n\n\fDoctor: What medications are you currently taking?\n\nPatient:  Im  on  the  following  medications:  Cap  Urso  250mg  twice  daily,  Risek  40mg  once  daily,\n\nMotilium  10mg  three  times  daily,  Qalsan-D  once  daily,  Ensure  milk  powder  6  tablespoons  twice\n\ndaily, and Beneprotein twice daily.\n\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. Have you taken any other medications in the past?\n\nPatient:  Yes,  I  was  on  injections  of  Ceftriaxone  2gms  once  daily  for  seven  days,  Vitamin  K  once\n\ndaily for three days, and Hepamerz syrup twice daily.\n\nDoctor: Got it. Lets now talk about your social history. Do you have any cultural or spiritual needs\n\nthat we should consider in your care?\n\nPatient: No, I dont have any special cultural or spiritual needs.\n\nDoctor: Alright. What about your financial situation? Are there any strains you are facing?\n\nPatient: Yes, Ive been facing some financial difficulties. I was working as an executive at a telecom\n\ncompany in Islamabad, but I had to quit my job four months ago due to my health.\n\nDoctor:  I  see.  How  about  your  family?  Do  you  have  any  family  history  of  diseases  like  diabetes,\n\nhypertension, cancer, tuberculosis, or asthma?\n\nPatient: My father passed away in July 2020 due to pulmonary tuberculosis and liver disease, but\n\nthe exact cause wasnt known.\n\n\fDoctor: Im sorry to hear about your father. Lets talk about your psychological health. Have you been\n\nfeeling depressed or had any suicidal thoughts recently?\n\nPatient: No, I havent felt depressed, and I dont have any suicidal thoughts.\n\nDoctor: Thats good to hear. Now, moving on to your physical health, do you have any issues with\n\nlanguage, speech, vision, or mobility?\n\nPatient: No, I dont have any impairments in those areas.\n\nDoctor: Great. Now lets go over your physical exam findings. Your consciousness is intact, and you\n\nare  well-oriented  with  a  Glasgow  Coma  Scale  of  15/15.  On  examination,  your  heart  sounds  are\n\nnormal with no murmurs, your respiratory system shows normal vesicular breathing bilaterally, and\n\nyour abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended.\n\nPatient: Thats correct.\n\nDoctor:  Moving  on  to  the  investigations,  you  had  an  ERCP  on  July  11th,  and  it  showed  a  tight\n\nmid-CBD stricture. The procedure had to be abandoned due to complications. You then had a PTBD\n\non  July  13th,  which  showed  severe  stenosis  at  the  distal  CBD  level  and  required  an  internal  and\n\nexternal catheter placement.\n\nPatient: Yes, thats accurate. After the PTBD, I also had a transcatheter angiogram and embolization\n\nof the gastroduodenal artery due to an iatrogenic duodenal injury.\n\nDoctor: Exactly. A CT scan was done on July 18th, which showed signs of liver infarctions, biloma\n\nformation, and splenic infarctions with super-added infection. There was also significant intrahepatic\n\n\fcholestasis  and  moderate  ascites.  The  most  recent  CT  scan  showed  mild  intrahepatic  biliary\n\ndilatation and splenic infarction.\n\nPatient: Yes, I recall those findings.\n\nDoctor: Your lab results show elevated total bilirubin levels, which have decreased over time. Your\n\nrecent bilirubin level was 1.0, and your albumin levels are gradually improving. Your liver enzymes\n\nare also fluctuating, but theyre improving with time. You have a low BMI of 16.2, which we need to\n\naddress.\n\nPatient: Ive noticed my albumin levels improving, but my weight is still low.\n\nDoctor: Yes, nutritional rehabilitation is important for you to gain weight in preparation for possible\n\nsurgery. Your ECOG score is currently 1, which means you are fairly well but still need to focus on\n\nyour nutrition. We will be monitoring your weight closely.\n\nPatient: Understood.\n\nDoctor:  Based  on  your  diagnosis  and  history,  we  suspect  that  the  mid-CBD  stricture  and  the\n\ncommon  hepatic  duct  stricture  could  be  due  to  an  autoimmune  cause,  possibly  related  to  IgG4\n\ndisease. However, the data is not yet conclusive to start any specific treatment.\n\nPatient: I understand. What are the next steps?\n\nDoctor: The next step would be to proceed with nutritional rehabilitation. You need to increase your\n\nBMI to above 18.5 to prepare for surgery. We will also discuss your case in the MDT to determine\n\nwhether  surgery  or  steroid  therapy  is  the  best  option.  Ill  refer  you  to  Dr.  Ahmad  Karim,  a\n\n\fgastroenterologist,  for  his  opinion  on  steroid  therapy.  We  will  also  order  systemic  IgG4  levels  to\n\nfurther investigate the autoimmune aspect.\n\nPatient: Okay, Ill focus on improving my nutrition.\n\nDoctor:  Once  your  nutrition  improves  and  your  BMI  reaches  the  target,  we  will  reevaluate  the\n\nsituation. We will follow up after a month to assess the results of the steroid therapy trial and review\n\nthe MDT decision. We will keep you updated on the next steps.                                                           \n\n                             Patient:\n\nI  was  doing  fine  about  four  months  ago,  but  then  I  suddenly  developed  progressive  jaundice.  My\n\nbilirubin levels went up to 54.5, so I had an ERCP, but that didn't work. Afterward, I was admitted to\n\nQuad  e  Azam  International  Hospital  for  a  Percutaneous  Transhepatic  Biliary  Drainage  (PTBD)\n\nprocedure. That was done by Military Hospital, but after the procedure, I had a major complication \n\nan  upper  GI  bleed,  and  I  ended  up  vomiting  blood.  I  was  referred  for  a  repeat  PTBD  and\n\nembolization of the gastroduodenal artery. I stayed in the hospital from July 18th to August 6th.\n\nI also had hepatitis B and C screenings, and both came back negative.\n\nOver the last few months, I've lost about 15 kg of weight, and I had to get 5 pints of blood transfused\n\ndue to low hemoglobin levels.\n\nRight now, I'm not taking any medication.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThat sounds like quite a difficult period. Let me review the details.\n\nYou had an ERCP on July 11th, where a tight mid-common bile duct (CBD) stricture was identified,\n\nbut the procedure had to be abandoned. Then, on July 13th, the PTBD was done, and the findings\n\nincluded  a  dilated  left-sided  duct  and  severe  stenosis  at  the  distal  CBD  level.  Both  external  and\n\n\finternal  catheters  were  placed.  Afterward,  you  had  an  angiogram  and  embolization  of  the\n\ngastroduodenal artery to manage the duodenal injury and hematoma.\n\nOn  August  22nd,  the  case  was  discussed  in  a  multi-disciplinary  team  (MDT)  meeting,  and  they\n\nconcluded  that  you  have  a  benign  CBD  stricture,  for  which  dilation  through  PTBD  was  done.  Mild\n\ndilation  of  the  ductal  system  was  observed,  and  they  recommended  stenting  and  internalizing  the\n\nPTBD.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes,  I  remember  all  that.  Then,  on  September  23rd,  I  had  another  ERCP  at  PKLI.  The  diagnosis\n\nafterward  was  common  hepatic  duct  and  bile  duct  stricture.  During  that  procedure,  they  found  a\n\npreviously  placed  plastic  pancreatic  duct  stent  and  a  percutaneous  drain.  The  cholangiogram\n\nrevealed  a  hepatic  duct  stricture,  and  the  cholangioscope  showed  some  abnormal  mucosa  in  the\n\ncommon  bile  duct,  likely  caused  by  inflammation  from  the  previously  placed  stent.  They  took  a\n\nforceps  biopsy,  and  a  single  plastic  biliary  stent  was  placed  in  the  left  hepatic  duct  with  good\n\ndrainage.\n\nI also had several imaging studies:\n\nA CT scan from July 18th showed subcapsular areas in the liver and multifocal splenic infarctions,\n\npossibly from a previous infection.\n\nAnother CT scan on August 16th showed some biliary stents, mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation, and\n\na hypodense area in the right lobe of the liver, which could be an evolving abscess. There was also\n\nsome infection in my lower left lung.\n\nI had a histopathology report from October 1st. The biopsy results indicated mild inflammation and\n\n\fminimal fibrosis in the common hepatic duct and bile duct, with a predominantly lymphoplasmacytic\n\ninfiltrate. They suspect IgG4-related disease and suggested correlating with serum IgG4 levels.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThe  biopsies  suggest  IgG4-related  disease,  which  is  characterized  by  fibrosis  and  inflammation  in\n\nthe bile ducts, among other tissues. It's good that you've had comprehensive imaging and lab tests.\n\nYour  labs  from  earlier  this  year  show  significant  fluctuations,  particularly  in  bilirubin  and  liver\n\nenzymes.  Your  most  recent  lab  results  (as  of  October  10th)  indicate  that  your  bilirubin  is  down  to\n\n1.0, which is an improvement. Your albumin and platelet count are also within more normal ranges\n\nnow. However, your liver enzymes (ALT and AST) remain elevated.\n\nWe  will  need  to  continue  monitoring  this  closely,  especially  considering  the  IgG4-related  disease\n\nsuspicion.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, I saw that my bilirubin has improved, but the liver enzymes are still high. Whats the next step?\n\nDoctor:\n\nBased  on  your  condition  and  the  findings  from  your  imaging,  were  planning  to  continue  your\n\ntreatment with corticosteroids. I'll prescribe prednisolone 30 mg once daily for the next four weeks,\n\nalong  with  omeprazole  40  mg  for  gastric  protection,  and  a  calcium  +  vitamin  D  supplement.\n\nAdditionally, Id recommend that we check your serum IgG4 levels to further assess the IgG4-related\n\ndisease.\n\nAfter four weeks, we will follow up with further imaging to assess the response and decide on the\n\nnext steps. This may include a triphasic CT scan as discussed in the MDT meeting.\n\n\fPatient:\n\nOkay, I understand. Thank you.\n\nFollow-up Virtual Clinic Visit on November 22, 2024\n\nDoctor:\n\nHello, I see youve been dealing with the mid-distal CBD and common hepatic duct stricture for some\n\ntime now. Youve already had several procedures, including ERCP, PTBD, and an angiogram with\n\nembolization of the gastroduodenal artery.\n\nWe  had  another  MDT  discussion,  and  the  consensus  is  to  continue  with  your  current  medical\n\ntreatment  and  proceed  with  further  imaging,  particularly  a  triphasic  CT  scan.  This  will  give  us  a\n\nbetter idea of how things are progressing and help us plan the next steps.\n\nLets also continue monitoring your IgG4 levels and liver function closely. Please make sure to take\n\nthe prescribed medications regularly and keep track of any new symptoms.\n\nPatient:\n\nThank you, I will continue with the medications as you suggested. I will get the CT scan done and\n\nfollow up as advised.\n\nLab Results Summary:\n\nHemoglobin (Hb): 9.4 (07/07/24)  8.7 (04/08/24)\n\nWBC (White Blood Cells): 22.5 (07/07/24)  18.81 (04/08/24)\n\n\fPlatelets (PLTS): 593 (07/07/24)  638 (04/08/24)\n\nTotal Bilirubin: 54.5 (07/07/24)  1.7 (04/08/24)  1.82 (06/09/24)  1.0 (10/10/2024)\n\nDirect Bilirubin: 37.1 (07/07/24)  1.4 (04/08/24)  1.59 (06/09/24)  0.7 (10/10/2024)\n\nALT/AST: 92/92 (07/07/24)  108/46 (04/08/24)  128/63 (06/09/24)  173/86 (10/10/2024)\n\nAlkaline Phosphatase: 312 (07/07/24)  297 (04/08/24)  131 (06/09/24)  216 (10/10/2024)\n\nAlbumin: 2.1 (07/07/24)  3.8 (04/08/24)  4.12 (06/09/24)  4.6 (10/10/2024)\n\nCreatinine: 0.6 (07/07/24)  0.64 (04/08/24)\n\nSodium (Na+): 127 (07/07/24)  136 (04/08/24)\n\nPotassium (K+): 4.44 (07/07/24)  4.26 (04/08/24)\n\nINR: 1.0 (07/07/24)  0.93 (04/08/24)\n\nCA 19-9: 9.57 (10/10/2024)\n\nSerum Ceruloplasmin: 59 (normal)\n\nImmunology:\n\nAnti Nuclear Antibodies: Homogeneous\n\n\fAnti Mitochondrial Antibodies: Negative\n\nAnti Smooth Muscle Antibodies: Negative\n\nSerum Antiparietal Cells Antibodies: Negative\n\nAutoimmune Liver Disease Profile: Negative\n\nHepatitis B & C Screening: Negative\n\nBMI: 16.2 (07/07/24)  16.6 (04/08/24)\n\nECOG: 1 (consistent)\n\nBlood Group: O+ve\n\nPlan:\n\nContinue current medications: Prednisolone, Omeprazole, Calcium + Vitamin D\n\nFollow-up with triphasic CT scan\n\nRefer to hepatology for further management\n\n\f",

I was completely fine before that.\n\nDoctor: Alright. Have you had any previous medical conditions?\n\nPatient:  Yes,  I  have  Parkinsons  disease  and  Im  taking  Sinemet  tablets  for  that.  I  also  have\n\nhypertension and diabetes.\n\nDoctor: Got it. Have you had any tests done so far?\n\nPatient: Yes. A CT scan was done recently. It showed thickened gallbladder with a mass in it, but\n\ntheres no vascular thrombosis.\n\nDoctor: Alright. Let me also check your labs. On 7th January 2025:\n\nHemoglobin: 13\n\n\fPlatelets: 522\n\nWBC: 8.15\n\nALP: 256\n\nALT: 36\n\nTotal Bilirubin: 16.5\n\nDirect Bilirubin: 14.1\n\nIndirect Bilirubin: 2.4\n\nAlbumin: 3.6\n\nCreatinine: 0.6\n\nINR: 1.3\n\nCA 19-9: 425\n\nCA 125: 12.6\n\nHepatitis B and C: Negative\n\n\fDoctor:  Have  you  experienced  any  significant  weight  loss,  vomiting  of  blood,  black  stools,  or\n\nrequired any blood transfusions?\n\nPatient: No, none of that. Just weakness and the symptoms I mentioned earlier.\n\nDoctor:  Noted.  Well  need  to  do  further  assessment.  The  MRCP  done  on  16th  December  2024\n\nshows  nodular  thickening  of  the  gallbladder  wall,  involving  the  fundus,  body,  and  cystic  duct,  with\n\ndilation of intrahepatic biliary ducts. Theres also a raised right hemidiaphragm on chest X-ray.\n\nDoctor: This is suggestive of a gallbladder mass likely causing obstructive jaundice. Ill book you for\n\nERCP  and  EUS.  Well  also  refer  you  to  a  hepatobiliary  surgeon.  The  CD  of  your  scans  will  be\n\nsubmitted for review.\n\nDate: 15 January 2025  HPB and LTX Evaluation\n\nDoctor: Let's discuss in detail. You mentioned that you were doing fine until three months ago?\n\nPatient: Yes, thats correct. I started feeling the abdominal pain and then noticed jaundice. Imaging\n\nrevealed a gallbladder mass and I was referred here.\n\nDoctor: Alright. Do you have any history of hepatitis?\n\nPatient: No. I tested negative for both HBV and HCV.\n\nDoctor: Have you had any episodes of hematemesis, ascites, or confusion?\n\nPatient: No, none of those. Just jaundice.\n\n\fDoctor: Any significant weight loss, fevers, or night sweats?\n\nPatient: No to all of those.\n\nDoctor: Have you had any previous surgeries?\n\nPatient: Yes, I had LCSC about 25 years ago.\n\nDoctor: Any allergies?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nDoctor: What medications are you currently taking?\n\nPatient: Im taking:\n\nDomperidone 10 mg, three times a day\n\nOmeprazole 40 mg, once a day\n\nGlucerna powder, 20 g, three times a day\n\nSinemet tablet, once daily\n\nDoctor: Any addictions?\n\n\fPatient: No, none at all.\n\nDoctor: Whats your family history like?\n\nPatient: Unremarkableno known cancers, TB, diabetes, or asthma.\n\nDoctor: Do you face any financial issues?\n\nPatient: Yes, we are under financial strain.\n\nDoctor: Are you educated?\n\nPatient: No, Im uneducated. Im a housewife and married.\n\nDoctor: Alright. On examination today:\n\nCNS: Youre conscious and oriented, GCS 15/15\n\nCVS: Normal heart sounds\n\nRespiratory: Clear vesicular breathing\n\nAbdomen: Soft, non-tender, not distended\n\nDoctor: Lets go over your scans again:\n\nUSG on 9 December 2024: Thick-walled, collapsed gallbladder with a 23 mm lesion\n\n\fCT  Scan  on  7  January  2025:  Enlarged  liver,  circumferential  enhancing  wall  thickness  in  the\n\ngallbladder fundus, distended GB body, no stones, mild thickening of biliary ducts, CBD 3.3 mm, no\n\nlymph nodes, pancreas normal\n\nMRCP on 16 December 2024: Nodular GB wall thickening, intrahepatic biliary dilation suggestive of\n\nmalignancy\n\nDoctor: Lab summary from 7 Jan 2025:\n\nHb: 13.1\n\nWBC: 8.15\n\nPlatelets: 522\n\nBilirubin (Total/Direct): 16.5 / 14.1\n\nALT: 36\n\nALP: 256\n\nAlbumin: 3.6\n\nCreatinine: 0.6\n\nSodium: 131\n\n\fPotassium: 4.1\n\nINR: 1.3\n\nCA 125: 12.8\n\nDoctor: The assessment suggests likely carcinoma of the gallbladder. Well:\n\nReview your CT if uploaded properly\n\nGet tumor markers\n\nDo a CT chest if not already done\n\nReview again in clinic once results are in\n\nDate: 16 January 2025  Follow-Up\n\nDoctor: Were still waiting on the CT report from PKLI and the CA 19-9 level.\n\nDoctor: Previously, your CT showed:\n\nLiver enlargement\n\nThickened gallbladder wall in the fundus\n\n\fCollapsed lumen, no stones\n\nMild thickening of bile ducts\n\nNo lymphadenopathy\n\nNormal pancreas\n\nDoctor: MRCP also shows concern for gallbladder malignancy.\n\nDoctor: Lab results from 7 Jan 2025 still hold:\n\nCA 125: 12.8\n\nCA 19-9: Awaiting\n\nDoctor: You were seen in OPD by our team. CT was uploaded but arterial phase is missing, so were\n\ngetting a fresh CT triphasic today. Follow-up in the afternoon after the scan.\n\nDate: 17 January 2025  Post Triphasic CT\n\nDoctor: We reviewed the triphasic CT liver with HCC protocol done today. It shows:\n\nThickening of the right-sided ducts up to the CBD\n\nSmooth enhancing thickened gallbladder wall\n\n\fEnhancement and thickening of CHD and CBD\n\nMild intrahepatic biliary dilatation\n\nNo obvious metastatic disease\n\nDoctor: This is likely a malignant lesion involving the right ductal system.\n\nDoctor: The surgical plan includes:\n\nStandard right hepatectomy with caudate lobe excision\n\nRoux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy\n\nFrozen section and assessment of distal CBD\n\nDoctor: But your bilirubin is currently too high for surgery.\n\nDoctor: Well refer you to hepatology for ERCP and stenting of the left hepatic duct to drain the left\n\nbiliary system. This should help improve cholestasis.\n\nDoctor: Ill ask our coordinator, Zubair, to schedule surgery after the ERCP and stenting.\n\nDoctor: Just to inform you, the mortality risk is around 5%, and morbidity is about 1520%. Theres a\n\n3040% chance of recurrence. Weve explained all this in detail.\n\nDate: 20 January 2025  Hepatology Clinic\n\n\fDoctor: Youve been referred from HPB for ERCP. Based on your current presentation:\n\nYou have obstructive jaundice due to a malignant lesion in the right ductal system.\n\nYour CA 19-9 is now more than 1000.\n\nDoctor: CT Triphasic findings from 17 Jan confirm:\n\nThickened right-sided ducts up to CBD\n\nIntrahepatic biliary dilatation\n\nThickened enhancing gallbladder wall\n\nNo signs of metastasis\n\nDoctor: MRCP on 16 Dec also points to gallbladder malignancy.\n\nDoctor: Lab results on 15 Jan:\n\nHb: 13.1\n\nWBC: 8.15\n\nPlatelets: 522\n\n\fTotal Bilirubin: 16.5\n\nDirect Bilirubin: 14.1\n\nALT: 36\n\nALP: 256\n\nAlbumin: 3.6\n\nCreatinine: 0.6\n\nSodium: 131\n\nPotassium: 4.1\n\nINR: 1.3\n\nCA 125: 12.8\n\nCA 19-9: >1000\n\nDoctor:  The  next  step  is  to  proceed  with  ERCP  and  stenting  of  the  left  hepatic  duct  to  improve\n\ndrainage and prepare you for surgery.\n\n\f",

I'm here today with my son, Mr. Aamir, who is doing his PhD in Biochemistry. I live in\n\nMirpur, AJK.\n\nDoctor:\n\nWelcome! I see you're experiencing some concerns. Can you tell me more about what brings you in\n\ntoday?\n\nPatient:\n\nYes,  Ive  been  dealing  with  a  few  issues  recently.  Ive  had  significant  weight  loss,  about  12-15\n\nkilograms, but I havent been able to track it properly. I also havent been able to sleep much, and my\n\nappetite is nearly gone. On top of that, Ive been experiencing central chest pain.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI see. Have you noticed any other symptoms, like fevers or night sweats?\n\nPatient:\n\nNo, I havent had any fevers or night sweats. Also, there have been no signs of physical or cognitive\n\nlimitations.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThats good to hear. Lets move on to your medical history. I see that you have uncontrolled diabetes\n\n\fand have been diagnosed with APD. Is that right?\n\nPatient:\n\nYes,  that's  correct.  Ive  been  managing  diabetes,  but  its  not  well  controlled.  Also,  I  had  an  open\n\nappendectomy back in 1980, and I have no known allergies.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThank you for that information. Do you have any social or lifestyle habits I should be aware of?\n\nPatient:\n\nI live with my family in Mirpur, AJK. I have a BA degree and used to work as a shopkeeper, but Im\n\nnot working anymore. I used to smoke but quit seven years ago. I dont drink alcohol.\n\nDoctor:\n\nGot  it.  Id  like  to  review  your  recent  medical  tests.  You  had  some  investigations  done  recently,\n\ncorrect?\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, I did. I had an OGD on 10th February 2024 at SIH Islamabad, where the report showed two\n\nlymph nodes at the porta hepatis, the largest one measuring 1.3 x 1.4 cm. They didnt find any mass\n\nat the porta hepatis, but they took a biopsy.\n\nDoctor:\n\nAnd what did the biopsy show?\n\nPatient:\n\nThe biopsy showed no evidence of malignancy. It contained fragmented lymphoid tissue made up of\n\n\fmature lymphocytes.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI see. You also had a CT scan on 7th February 2024. What did the imaging report indicate?\n\nPatient:\n\nThe CT scan showed mild hepatomegaly, a subtle soft tissue fullness at the confluence of the right\n\nand left hepatic ducts, mild to moderate intrahepatic bile duct dilation, and a thrombosed left portal\n\nvein.  It  also  mentioned  some  prominent  upper  abdominal  nodes.  The  features  suggested\n\ncholangiocarcinoma, along with diffuse meso-omenteric congestion.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThank you for sharing that. Now, lets look at your recent lab results:\n\nHB: 12.9\n\nTLC: 8.5\n\nPLT: 187\n\nT-BIL: 1.63 (on 7th Feb) and 2.3 (on 14th March)\n\nD-BIL: 1.48 (on 7th Feb) and 1.6 (on 14th March)\n\nALT/AST: 72/81 (on 7th Feb) and 41/60 (on 14th March)\n\nALP: 442 (on 7th Feb) and 482 (on 14th March)\n\n\fAlbumin: Not available\n\nCreatinine: 0.62\n\nNa+: 139\n\nK+: 3.9\n\nINR: 0.98\n\nAFP: Not available\n\nCA 19-9: 406\n\nCEA: 0.6\n\nTSH: 2.20\n\nIgG4 Studies: Normal\n\nECOG: 0\n\nHep B and C: Negative\n\nDoctor:\n\nYour  liver  function  tests  show  some  elevated  bilirubin  levels,  especially  the  total  bilirubin,  which  is\n\n\fconcerning. Your CA 19-9 is also elevated, which can be associated with biliary diseases. However,\n\nyour  overall  condition  doesnt  indicate  any  immediate  critical  issues  for  now.  How  are  you  feeling\n\noverall?\n\nPatient:\n\nIve been feeling weak, but theres no major pain or discomfort right now. The chest pain has been\n\nmore occasional.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThank  you  for  updating  me  on  your  condition.  Based  on  everything  we  have  reviewed  so  far,  it\n\nseems  you  have  locally  advanced  cholangiocarcinoma,  and  the  left  lobe  of  your  liver  is  atrophic.\n\nTheres also involvement of the right posterior artery, and mild narrowing of the main portal vein.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhat does this mean for me, Doctor?\n\nDoctor:\n\nSince the disease is locally advanced, you are not a surgical candidate at the moment. However, we\n\nneed to further investigate to ensure we have a clear understanding of the situation. Id recommend\n\na fresh CT scan from PKLI, and then we can discuss it in the multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting\n\nto finalize the next steps.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhat will the next steps involve?\n\nDoctor:\n\nAfter the fresh CT scan, well meet with the MDT to decide on the best treatment plan. Ill also have\n\n\fyou meet with our coordinator, Asif, who will help facilitate any required services for you.\n\nFollow-Up Visit - 10/07/2024\n\nPatient:\n\nIm here for my follow-up visit. How is my condition now?\n\nDoctor:\n\nAfter  reviewing  your  situation,  its  clear  that  your  cholangiocarcinoma  is  still  locally  advanced,  and\n\nyou are not a suitable candidate for surgical resection. Your liver function tests have improved, and\n\nyour ECOG status is now at 1, indicating mild symptoms but not debilitating ones.\n\nPatient:\n\nSo, what is the plan now?\n\nDoctor:\n\nIn  light  of  the  locally  advanced  disease,  I  suggest  proceeding  with  an  ERCP  using  a  spyglass,\n\nfollowed  by  a  biopsy  for  further  analysis.  Once  we  have  the  biopsy  results,  we  will  refer  you  to\n\noncology  as  per  the  MDTs  decision  for  a  definitive  diagnosis  and  treatment  plan.  I  will  also\n\nrecommend holding urso therapy for now.\n\nPatient:\n\nAlright, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly.\n\n\f",

    "raw_text": "Gender: Female\n\nAge: 14\n\nMRN: 766532\n\nDiagnosis: Hepatocellular Carcinoma\n\nHistory and Physical:\n\nDoctor:\n\nHello, Umme Hani. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient:\n\nIm okay, Doctor, but I still have some concerns.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI see. Lets go over your medical history and the findings from your previous visits. You had your first\n\nvisit to the pediatric gastroenterology clinic on April 18, 2024, for complaints related to a history of\n\nupper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). Is that right?\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, Doctor. I had a major bleeding episode in December. I was in USOH, and I suddenly vomited\n\nblood. The next day, I had another episode, and I also passed black stools for three days.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI understand. You were admitted to Faisalabad Civil Hospital, where they performed an endoscopy\n\nand transfused two units of packed cells. You didnt need fresh frozen plasma. After that, you were\n\ntransferred  to  Nishtar  Hospital,  where  the  ultrasound  showed  an  unspecified  liver  disease.  Is  that\n\ncorrect?\n\nPatient:\n\n\fYes, thats correct.\n\nDoctor:\n\nLets  review  your  examination  findings.  Your  weight  is  31  kg,  and  your  height  is  157  cm,  which\n\nplaces you below the 3rd centile for weight and at the 25th centile for height. Theres no jaundice,\n\npallor, or edema. I also noted that your spleen was palpable by 3 cm but your liver wasnt palpable.\n\nPatient:\n\nI remember that. Its been hard for me to maintain a healthy weight.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYour  liver  function  tests  show  that  your  bilirubin  was  slightly  elevated  at  1.6  mg/dL,  and  your  liver\n\nenzymes (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT) were abnormal, with ALT at 93 and ALP at 990. Your albumin was\n\nlow at 2.7 g/dL, and your INR was 1.9, which is a bit concerning for liver dysfunction.\n\nPatient:\n\nThat sounds like its pretty serious.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYes,  Umme  Hani.  Your  liver  condition  is  indeed  concerning.  You  underwent  a  liver  biopsy  on\n\nJanuary  31,  2024,  which  showed  mild  interface  hepatitis  and  portal  tract  fibrosis,  without  cirrhotic\n\nnodules.  The  fibrosis  was  graded  at  stage  1,  but  moderate  portal  inflammation  was  present.  The\n\nultrasound on April 13, 2024, revealed coarse cirrhotic liver with a focal lesion in the left lobe, which\n\ncould  be  a  hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC).  Additionally,  the  CT  scan  on  January  2,  2024,\n\nconfirmed cirrhosis but didnt show any arterialized lesions to suggest HCC at that time.\n\nPatient:\n\n\fIm really worried about the HCC diagnosis. What does that mean for me?\n\nDoctor:\n\nYour condition has been closely monitored. The recent investigations, including a liver lesion biopsy\n\non April 24, 2024, confirmed the presence of well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in\n\nthe background of cirrhotic liver. This means that there is a liver cancer that has developed due to\n\nyour  chronic  liver  disease.  However,  there  are  no  signs  of  vascular  invasion,  which  is  somewhat\n\nreassuring.\n\nPatient:\n\nThat sounds serious. Whats the next step for me?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWe will need to start treatment for your condition. Weve prescribed Ceclor 500 mg twice a day for 5\n\ndays  and  Azithromycin  250  mg  once  a  day  for  3  days  to  manage  any  infections.  For  now,  we  will\n\ncontinue with regular monitoring. Your follow-up appointment is scheduled for May 27, 2024, and we\n\nwill also plan for an EGD and HRCT to further assess your condition. Well check your CBC, CRP,\n\nLFTs, RFTs, and PT/INR on your next visit.\n\nPatient:\n\nOkay, Doctor. Im worried about the next steps, but I will follow the plan.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI understand your concerns, Umme Hani. It's important to stay positive and follow the treatment plan\n\nclosely.  We  will  continue  to  monitor  your  condition  and  provide  the  necessary  care.  Well  see  you\n\nagain soon. Do you have any questions for me?\n\n\fPatient:\n\nNot at the moment, Doctor. Ill see you at the next visit. Thank you.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYoure welcome. Take care of yourself, Umme Hani.\n\nPatient: Hello, doctor. Im here for my follow-up visit.\n\nDoctor:  Hi,  how  have  you  been  feeling  since  our  last  visit?  Lets  start  with  a  review  of  your  recent\n\ntests and reports.\n\nPatient: Im still having some issues with my liver, as you know. Im a bit concerned.\n\nDoctor: Lets go through everything. From the lab results on 30.03.2024, your IgG level is 7.7. Your\n\nceruloplasmin is at 29, and your 24-hour urinary copper is 10.55. We also have your iron levels at\n\n40, TIBC at 338, and ferritin at 102 from 13.01.2024. You were also tested for hepatitis B and C, and\n\nboth HBsAg and Anti-HCV are negative.\n\nPatient: Ive heard the term PELD/MELD before. What is that about?\n\nDoctor: Your PELD/MELD score is 16 points. This is a scoring system used to assess the severity of\n\nliver disease and help prioritize patients for a liver transplant.\n\n\fPatient: What about the MDT outcome?\n\nDoctor:  On  06.05.2024,  the  multidisciplinary  team  reviewed  your  case.  Radiologically  and\n\npathologically,  it  appears  theres  a  solitary  HCC  in  segment  II  of  your  liver.  Theres  no  vascular\n\ninvasion or extrahepatic disease at this time. Your liver disease doesnt have a clear etiology, but its\n\nfibrotic on histology. Given your presentation, were considering locoregional treatment for now, with\n\nfollow-up afterward.\n\nPatient: So, I do have cancer, right?\n\nDoctor: Yes, you have a well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The liver lesion biopsy\n\ndone  on  24.04.2024  confirmed  this.  It  shows  atypical  hepatocytes  with  prominent  nucleoli  and\n\nthickened  hepatic  plates.  Theres  also  steatosis  and  lobular  inflammation,  but  theres  no\n\nlymphovascular invasion.\n\nPatient: That sounds serious. What other biopsy results did we have?\n\nDoctor: We also did a liver parenchymal biopsy, and it showed chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. There\n\nwas marked portal inflammation and ductular proliferation, along with moderate lobular inflammation\n\nand spotty necrosis. Macrovesicular steatosis was observed, and no cholestasis was present. The\n\nMetavir score for activity is A3/A3, and for fibrosis, it's F3-4/F4.\n\nPatient: I see. How does the liver look overall?\n\nDoctor:  From  the  ultrasound  shearwave  done  on  19.04.2024,  it  shows  an  F4  stage  of  hepatic\n\nfibrosis, which indicates severe scarring of the liver. Your AFP is 30.98, which is another important\n\nmarker we monitor for liver cancer.\n\n\fPatient: What about the endoscopy I had?\n\nDoctor: Your endoscopy results from 24.04.2024 show two columns of grade 3 esophageal varices\n\nwith  red  signs,  which  we  treated  by  applying  two  bands.  Additionally,  there  was  mild  gastropathy\n\nand  gastritis,  with  biopsies  taken  from  your  gastric  antrum.  The  duodenum  showed  decreased\n\nmucosal folds and duodenal ulcers in D1, and biopsies were also taken there. We reviewed these\n\nfindings during your follow-up on 30.07.2024.\n\nPatient: Were there any changes after that?\n\nDoctor: Yes, on 30.07.2024, during the follow-up endoscopy, the esophageal varices were reduced\n\nto one column of grade 1, with no red signs. The gastric findings remained similar with mild gastritis.\n\nYour duodenal ulcers in D1 were still present, but no new complications were found.\n\nPatient: What about the CT scan and HRCT results?\n\nDoctor:  The  CT  scan  triphasic  done  on  19.04.2024  confirmed  macronodular  cirrhosis  and  a  left\n\nhepatic  lobe  HCC.  The  HRCT  chest  from  04.06.2024  showed  clearance  of  the  ground-glass\n\ninfiltrates  we  previously  saw,  suggesting  the  resolution  of  an  infection.  Importantly,  there  were  no\n\nmetastatic deposits in the chest.\n\nPatient: Thats some good news, I guess. Whats the plan now, doctor?\n\nDoctor: The plan is to proceed with a liver transplant. Your family has decided to move forward with\n\na living donor liver transplant (LDLT), although a donor with the same blood group isnt available yet.\n\nWe will consult with anesthesia tomorrow morning for preparation.\n\n\fPatient: What medications should I be taking?\n\nDoctor:  Continue  with  the  medications:  Inderal  (Propanolol)  10  mg  twice  a  day,  Aldactone\n\n(Spironolactone) 25 mg three times a day. Were decreasing the Spironolactone dose to twice a day.\n\nIve also prescribed ORA ADE drops (5 drops once daily) and Vitamin D 2 lac units once daily for 1\n\nmonth (for a total of 3 doses).\n\nPatient: How often will I need follow-up?\n\nDoctor:  Well  have  another  follow-up  in  one  month.  During  that  visit,  well  repeat  your  lab  tests,\n\nincluding CBC, LFTs, RFTs, S/E, PT/INR, and urine C/E. Well also plan for another endoscopy.\n\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I feel a bit reassured now.\n\nDoctor:  You're  welcome.  We're  closely  monitoring  your  condition,  and  well  continue  to  adjust  the\n\ntreatment as needed. Take care, and well see you soon for your follow-up.\n\nPatient:\n\nDoctor, Ive been feeling a bit weak lately, and my appetite has decreased. A few days ago, I had\n\nsome vomiting and loose stools, but I took some medicine from a nearby doctor, and now Im feeling\n\n\fbetter.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI see, let's go over your recent health status. Last time we discussed your liver condition. You have\n\nbeen diagnosed with well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on a background of cirrhotic\n\nliver. Let me check your latest examination results.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYou weigh 32 kg, which is below the 3rd centile for your age, and your height is 155 cm, at the 25th\n\ncentile. There's no jaundice, pallor, or edema. On your cardiovascular exam, your heart sounds are\n\nnormal, and your CNS is intact. Your respiratory exam is clear. The spleen is palpable by 1 cm, but\n\nyour liver is not palpable, and there is no evidence of ascites.\n\nPatient:\n\nIve been following the treatment plan. What does the doctor think about my condition now?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWe continue to monitor your liver condition closely. Youve had various tests, including a liver biopsy,\n\nendoscopy,  and  imaging.  Your  liver  biopsy  shows  chronic  hepatitis  and  cirrhosis  with  significant\n\nportal  inflammation,  moderate  lobular  inflammation,  and  steatosis.  The  AFP  (Alpha-Fetoprotein)  is\n\nelevated,  which  is  a  marker  for  liver  cancer.  Your  CT  scan  also  indicates  cirrhosis  and  a\n\nhepatocellular carcinoma in the left hepatic lobe.\n\nPatient:\n\nSo, whats the next step in my treatment?\n\nDoctor:\n\n\fGiven  your  diagnosis,  the  definitive  treatment  is  a  liver  transplant  (LDLT).  However,  we  are  still\n\nfacing  the  challenge  of  finding  a  compatible  donor  with  the  same  blood  type.  Your  family  has\n\ndecided to proceed with the liver transplant once a suitable donor is found. In the meantime, we'll\n\ncontinue your medications and monitor your liver function.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhat medications do I need to keep taking?\n\nDoctor:\n\nYou are prescribed the following:\n\nPropranolol (Inderal) 10 mg twice daily\n\nSpironolactone 25 mg twice daily\n\nORA ADE drops (5 drops once daily)\n\nVitamin D (2 lac units, once daily, for a month)\n\nOmeprazole 20 mg once daily\n\nEnsure formula milk for nutritional support\n\nSurbex Z (1 tablet once daily)\n\nVitamin K 2 mg twice weekly\n\n\fDoctor:\n\nYour liver condition requires close monitoring, so we will repeat all your labs and AFP levels at your\n\nnext  follow-up.  We  will  also  conduct  an  ultrasound  of  your  abdomen.  You  should  also  maintain  a\n\nhealthy diet and continue with the supplements as advised.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhat about my recent test results?\n\nDoctor:\n\nYour liver workup shows no autoimmune causes for your liver disease. All autoimmune markers are\n\nnegative,  including  anti-LKM-1,  ANA,  AMA,  and  ASMA.  Your  copper  and  ferritin  levels  are  within\n\nrange, and your liver enzymes are being monitored closely. Your PELD/MELD score is 16, indicating\n\nthe severity of your liver condition.\n\nYour CT scan shows macronodular cirrhosis, and the HRCT chest indicates clearance of previous\n\nlung infiltrates. There's no sign of metastasis.\n\nDoctor:\n\nBased on the multidisciplinary team meeting on 06.05.24, your liver disease is progressing, and we'll\n\nconsider locoregional treatments for now, alongside follow-up care.\n\nPatient:\n\nAnd when should I come for my next visit?\n\nDoctor:\n\nYou should follow up with us in about a month. In the meantime, well keep a close eye on your liver\n\nfunction and AFP levels. If a donor with the same blood group becomes available, we'll arrange for\n\n\fthe transplant. Weve also arranged for parent counseling to support your family during this process.\n\nPatient:\n\nThank you, doctor. Ill follow all the instructions and stay in touch for the follow-up.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYou're welcome. Keep in mind that we are here for any questions or concerns. Stay well, and well\n\nsee you in a month for your next follow-up.\n\n\f",

    "raw_text": "Gender: Male\n\nAge: 42\n\nMRN: 768771\n\nDiagnosis: Hepatocellular Carcinoma\n\nHistory and Physical:\n\nDoctor:\n\nHello, how have you been since your last visit?\n\nPatient:\n\nI  have  been  feeling  some  pain  in  the  right  hypochondriac  (RHC)  and  epigastric  region.  It's  been\n\nbothering me for a few months now.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI see. Last time, we discussed a potential hepatic mass. Based on your CT scans, the lesion could\n\nbe indicative of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), though there was a possibility of an atypical\n\nhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). How are you managing with the medications?\n\nPatient:\n\nIm  still  on  the  medications  you  prescribedTres  Orix,  Tramadol  for  the  pain,  and  Laxoberon  for\n\nconstipation. I havent had any major issues, but the pain persists.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThat's  good  to  hear  that  you're  managing  well  with  the  medications.  How  is  your  weight?  Any\n\nsignificant changes lately?\n\nPatient:\n\nIve lost about 5-7 kg in the past year. Its been gradual.\n\n\fDoctor:\n\nNoted. Have you noticed any other symptoms like fatigue, jaundice, or changes in your appetite?\n\nPatient:\n\nNo, no jaundice or anything like that. I do feel tired at times, and Ive been having some bloating and\n\ndiscomfort in my stomach.\n\nDoctor:\n\nAlright,  lets  go  over  some  of  your  investigations.  Your  CT  scan  from  May  8th  showed  a  large\n\nheterogeneously enhancing mass in the right hypochondrium, and the findings are more consistent\n\nwith  GIST,  not  HCC.  The  lesion  is  quite  large,  and  it  appears  to  involve  the  posterior  wall  of  the\n\npylorus and antrum. Its likely causing the pain and discomfort you mentioned.\n\nPatient:\n\nThat sounds like a pretty serious issue. Whats next?\n\nDoctor:\n\nYes, its important we proceed carefully. Your liver biopsy from June 5th confirmed the presence of\n\nan epithelioid-type GIST. This type of tumor can sometimes be difficult to treat, but we have options.\n\nWe are planning a resection of the tumor with a left hepatectomy.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhat exactly does that mean for me?\n\nDoctor:\n\nEssentially,  well  need  to  surgically  remove  the  tumor.  The  liver  will  also  need  to  be  part  of  the\n\n\fresection, so it's a more complex procedure. The team will be monitoring you closely throughout the\n\nprocess. Well also need to discuss the approach further with a multidisciplinary team (MDT) to make\n\nsure all options are considered.\n\nPatient:\n\nOkay, that makes sense. Is there anything else I need to be aware of before the surgery?\n\nDoctor:\n\nBefore  we  proceed,  well  do  a  few  more  things.  We'll  make  sure  your  blood  levels  are  stable,\n\nespecially  your  hemoglobin.  I  see  that  it  was  quite  low  during  your  last  visit  (6.6),  so  well  need  to\n\nensure you're getting the necessary blood transfusions. We may need to give you another round of\n\npacked  red  blood  cells.  We  also  need  to  address  the  weight  loss  and  the  low  grade  fever  you've\n\nbeen experiencing.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, I had 2 PCV transfusions before, but the hemoglobin hasn't gone up much since.\n\nDoctor:\n\nWell continue monitoring your hemoglobin and make sure you get the right support. Lets also keep\n\nyour liver function under close observation. I'll arrange a referral to the coordinator for further steps\n\nand ensure everything is lined up for the surgery.\n\nPatient:\n\nThank you, Doctor. Im a bit anxious, but I trust your plan.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI  understand  your  concern,  but  we  will  take  good  care  of  you.  It's  important  that  we  proceed  with\n\n\fcaution and make sure all steps are thoroughly planned. After the surgery, well continue monitoring\n\nyour recovery closely.\n\nPatient:\n\nSounds good. Ill follow up with all the appointments.\n\nDoctor:\n\nPerfect. Well see you again in two weeks for a follow-up. In the meantime, make sure you're staying\n\non  top  of  your  medications  and  any  further  instructions.  If  you  have  any  issues,  dont  hesitate  to\n\nreach out.\n\nDoctor:\n\nLets now review your medical history. You mentioned that youve had no decompensation symptoms\n\nand  you  havent  had  a  history  of  significant  liver  problems  before  this.  Youve  been  feeling  some\n\nlow-grade fever lately, which is something we will monitor.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, its been a bit of a concern for me, but its not too bad.\n\nDoctor:\n\nGood  to  note.  You've  also  mentioned  some  psychological  stress  due  to  your  current  health\n\ncondition, and I want to assure you that well help you manage this. You're not alone in this journey.\n\nPatient:\n\nI have been feeling a bit down with everything going on. Its just been a lot to handle.\n\nDoctor:\n\n\fIt's completely understandable. Well ensure you have support during this time, both physically and\n\nemotionally. We'll keep an eye on your mental health and offer resources as needed.\n\nPatient:\n\nI appreciate that, Doctor. Its reassuring to know you're keeping track of everything.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYou're welcome. You're in good hands. Well work together to ensure the best possible outcome. I'll\n\nmake sure we have everything in place for your surgery, and well discuss the next steps once we\n\nhave all the results.\n\nDoctor:\n\nFinally, let me go over the lab results from your last test on May 24th. Your liver function tests were\n\nas follows:\n\nBilirubin: 0.24\n\nALT: 13, AST: 18\n\nALP: 126\n\nAlbumin: 3.7\n\nCreatinine: 0.64\n\nSodium: 140\n\n\fPotassium: 4.25\n\nAFP: 6.93\n\nAll  of  these  values  are  within  normal  range,  though  well  continue  monitoring.  We'll  focus  on  your\n\nhemoglobin levels, as theyre a bit concerning, and plan for transfusion as needed.\n\nPatient:\n\nAlright, I understand. Thank you for explaining everything.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYou're  welcome.  Please  don't  hesitate  to  contact  me  if  you  have  any  questions.  See  you  in  two\n\nweeks for your follow-up.\n\n\f",

I've had anorexia and a low-grade fever. Also, I had a\n\ncholecystectomy  on  11/11/23  and  12  sessions  of  chemotherapy  for  adenocarcinoma  of  the\n\npancreas, which I completed on 15/05/24.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI  see.  You've  had  a  biopsy  on  8/6/24,  which  showed  moderately  differentiated  adenocarcinoma  of\n\nthe  pancreatic  mass.  You  also  had  a  CT  scan  on  5/9/24,  which  showed  a  fairly  defined  lobulated\n\nmass  in  the  pancreas,  with  involvement  of  the  head,  neck,  and  uncinate  process.  The  mass  is\n\ncompressing  and  stretching  the  SMV,  and  there's  also  marked  intrahepatic  cholestasis.  I  also\n\nnoticed partial encasement of the IVC.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, that sounds like the situation. The CT also mentioned that I have some lymphadenopathy and\n\na mass at the upper abdomen.\n\nDoctor:\n\nRight. Your lab results from 6/9/24 show:\n\nTotal Bilirubin: 8\n\n\fALT: 84\n\nALP: 236\n\nIt seems you're not on any medications currently, and you dont have any significant past medical or\n\nsurgical history other than the cholecystectomy.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, thats right.\n\nDoctor:\n\nBased  on  this,  you  have  biopsy-proven  adenocarcinoma  of  the  pancreas  with  locally  advanced\n\ndisease and high bilirubin levels. Here's what we'll do:\n\nWe'll carry out all baseline investigations, including CA 19-9, which is 38.5, and schedule a triphasic\n\nCT scan.\n\nYou may need an ERCP for decompression of the biliary system.\n\nIll refer you to the ER for admission.\n\nPatient:\n\nOkay, Doctor. Thank you.\n\nFollow-up Visit (10/10/24)\n\n\fPatient:\n\nDoctor, Ive been feeling worse since my last visit. I still have jaundice and have been feeling quite\n\nnauseous with loss of appetite.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI understand. Youre a known case of biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with duodenal\n\ninfiltration. Youve completed 14 chemotherapy sessions, the last one was three months ago. How\n\nare you feeling now?\n\nPatient:\n\nIve been very tired, and I still have some mild tenderness around the PTC site. The jaundice hasn't\n\nimproved much, and I also have some drainage from the site  about 300ml in 24 hours.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI see. Let me go over your recent investigations. On 26/09/24, during the ERCP, a large, ulcerated\n\ntumor  mass  was  found  in  the  ampullary  region.  There  was  some  self-limiting  bleeding,  and\n\nunfortunately,  we  couldnt  take  a  biopsy  because  of  the  friable  mucosa.  We  will  refer  you  for\n\npercutaneous transhepatic cholangiography.\n\nPatient:\n\nThat sounds concerning.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYes, I understand. The endoscopy on 30/09/24 revealed a large, infiltrating, ulcerated mass in the\n\nduodenum.  We  took  biopsies  for  histopathology.  The  result  from  04/10/24  confirmed  poorly\n\ndifferentiated adenocarcinoma with a pancreaticobiliary origin.\n\n\fAlso, your CT scan on 24/09/24 showed a hypo-enhancing, irregularly margined mass involving the\n\npancreas,  infiltrating  the  second  and  third  parts  of  the  duodenum.  This  mass  is  abutting  major\n\nvessels like the portal vein, SMV, IVC, and GDA, and it's causing biliary dilatation.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhat does that mean for me, Doctor?\n\nDoctor:\n\nIt  suggests  locally  advanced  adenocarcinoma  of  the  pancreas  with  significant  lymphadenopathy.\n\nYour current lab results from 01/10/24 show:\n\nBilirubin: 4.48\n\nALT: 27\n\nAST: 44\n\nAlbumin: 4.0\n\nCreatinine: 0.41\n\nNa: 128\n\nK: 4.04\n\nHb: 8.7\n\n\fWBC: 12.08\n\nPlatelet: 569\n\nINR: 1.21\n\nCA 19-9: 922.6\n\nThese indicate liver involvement and elevated tumor markers.\n\nPatient:\n\nThats a lot of information. Whats the next step?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWell  discuss  your  case  in  the  multidisciplinary  team  (MDT)  meeting  tomorrow  regarding  potential\n\nresection. I will also refer you to the HPB team for a surgical review. After the MDT, well update you\n\non the treatment plan.\n\nFollow-up Visit (11/10/24)\n\nPatient:\n\nDoctor, Ive been struggling with jaundice and anorexia for the past month. Im worried about the next\n\nsteps.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYouve  had  extended  cholecystectomy  for  gallbladder  mass  on  11/11/23,  and  the  biopsy  showed\n\nwell-differentiated adenocarcinoma of biliary type. Your pancreatic adenocarcinoma is now involving\n\n\fthe duodenum. Youve had 14 chemotherapy sessions, with the last one done three months ago.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, Ive been feeling quite weak. What do the doctors think about my situation?\n\nDoctor:\n\nThe most recent findings show recurrence and residual disease involving both your gallbladder and\n\npancreas. Your lab results are still concerning:\n\nBilirubin: 4.48\n\nALT: 27\n\nAST: 44\n\nAlbumin: 4.0\n\nCreatinine: 0.41\n\nWBC: 12.08\n\nPlatelet: 569\n\nINR: 1.21\n\nCA 19-9: 922.6\n\nYour BMI is 18, indicating significant weight loss.\n\n\fPatient:\n\nWhats the next plan, Doctor?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWell proceed with a PET scan. If the disease is localized, surgery may be an option, although theres\n\na risk of recurrence. Well also continue with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\n\nPatient:\n\nThank you, Doctor. I appreciate the updates.\n\nMDT Outcome (18/10/24)\n\nClinical Coordinator:\n\nWe have discussed the patients case in the MDT. The next step is to proceed with a PET scan.

It comes with nausea.\n\nDoctor: Have you ever passed a stone?\n\nPatient: No, I havent. But Ive had episodes of hematuria.\n\nDoctor: Are you on any treatment right now?\n\nPatient: I was given medical dissolution therapy.\n\nDoctor: Any other health conditions or comorbidities?\n\nPatient: No, nothing else.\n\nDoctor: Ive reviewed your ultrasound (USG KUB). It shows you have a left renal calculus. Im going\n\nto  order  a  few  tests  for  further  evaluation:  CT  KUB,  Urine  Culture  and  Routine  Examination,  and\n\nSerum Creatinine.\n\nFollow-up  17/08/23 (Urology)\n\nDoctor: You're following up for left flank pain, correct?\n\n\fPatient:  Yes,  it's  still  there.  I  also  experience  hesitation  while  passing  urine  on  and  off,  and  the\n\nnausea continues.\n\nDoctor:  Your  serum  creatinine  is  0.99,  which  is  normal.  Urine  culture  came  back  negative.  I\n\nreviewed your CT KUB  it shows a left staghorn calculus causing mild to moderate hydronephrosis.\n\nThere are also additional calculi in the lower pole and interpolar regions.\n\nPatient: Is that serious?\n\nDoctor: It requires intervention. Also, your CT showed hypodense areas in segment IV and VIII of\n\nthe  liver.  We  need  an  ultrasound  to  correlate  those  liver  findings.  For  the  kidney  stone,  we  will\n\nproceed with a PCNL (Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy). Anesthesia will evaluate you before surgery.\n\nHPB & LTx Clinic  04/07/24\n\nDoctor: Hello Anita. Youve come to us with lower back pain?\n\nPatient: Yes, but I also wanted to follow up on the liver issue. I had PCNL for my left renal stones\n\nlast  year  in  August.  But  when  I  got  a  CT  KUB  in  August  2023,  they  found  hypodense  areas  in\n\nsegment  IV  and  VIII  of  my  liver.  Nothing  was  done  at  that  time.  Then  in  May  2024,  I  had  an\n\nultrasound again, and they said the liver lesion had grown.\n\nDoctor: I see. And what did the biopsy show?\n\nPatient: It turned out to be moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.\n\nDoctor: Any other symptoms like jaundice, weight loss, hematemesis, or fevers?\n\n\fPatient: No, none of those. Also, my viral markers are negative. No history of blood transfusions or\n\nascites.\n\nDoctor: Any allergies?\n\nPatient: Yes, Im allergic to contrast.\n\nDoctor: Lets go through your investigation reports.\n\nUSG  Abdomen  (30.05.24)  shows  Grade  I  fatty  liver  and  a  focal  liver  defect  (6.0  x  4.9  x  5.5  cm  in\n\ncaudate lobe). Left renal calculi are still present.\n\nCT Scan (31.05.24) shows a necrotic liver lesion (6.81 x 6.07 cm in segment IV). No arterial phase\n\nenhancement or washout.\n\nLiver  Biopsy  (12.06.24)  confirms  moderately  differentiated  adenocarcinoma.  CK7  and  CAM5.2  are\n\npositive. HepPar1 and CDX2 are negative.\n\nOGD (28.06.24): Pangastritis, otherwise normal.\n\nColonoscopy (28.06.24): Two small rectal polyps, solitary rectal ulcer syndrome on biopsy.\n\nBilateral Mammography (01.07.24): BIRADS III in left breast with a 1.2 x 0.5 cm hypoechoic lesion.\n\nPET Scan (04.07.24): Report awaited.\n\nLab Results (27.06.24):\n\n\fHemoglobin: 9.6\n\nTLC: 8.1\n\nPlatelets: 272\n\nT-BIL: 0.6\n\nD-BIL: 0.2\n\nALT/AST: 36/25\n\nALP: 148\n\nAlbumin: 4.9\n\nAFP: 7.57\n\nCEA: <1.73\n\nCA125: 10.0\n\nCA19-9: 14.9\n\nDoctor: Your viral markers (HBsAg, Anti-HCV) are negative. ECOG performance score is 0, BMI is\n\n40.03,  and  your  blood  group  is  A  positive.  Do  you  have  any  history  of  addiction,  depression,  or\n\n\fthoughts of self-harm?\n\nPatient: No, none at all. I dont smoke or drink. Mentally, I feel fine.\n\nDoctor:  Thats  good  to  hear.  Based  on  the  CT  and  biopsy  findings,  we  suspect  intrahepatic  ductal\n\ncholangiocarcinoma.  If  your  PET  scan  doesnt  show  disease  elsewhere,  we  will  plan  a  central\n\nhepatectomy. If other lesions are seen, well reassess our approach.\n\nHPB & LTx Clinic  Follow-up on 11/07/24\n\nDoctor:  Welcome  back.  Weve  reviewed  your  PET  scan.  It  shows  a  hypermetabolic  hepatic  mass\n\nand a hypermetabolic hepatic hilar lymph node, which is likely metastatic.\n\nPatient: That sounds serious.\n\nDoctor:  It  does  indicate  a  poor  prognostic  factor,  but  the  good  news  is  the  lymph  node  can  be\n\nremoved during surgery. We'll proceed with central hepatectomy.\n\nPatient: Will I need any treatment after surgery?\n\nDoctor: Yes, we will recommend adjuvant chemotherapy after the surgery to reduce recurrence risk.\n\nYoull also be under surveillance post-treatment for early detection if anything returns.\n\nPatient: Alright, I understand.\n\nDoctor: Were referring you to the coordinator to schedule your surgery. Youve been strong through\n\nthis, and well do our best going forward.\n\n\fPost-Surgical Follow-Up  13/08/24\n\nPatient: Im here for follow-up after my central hepatectomy.\n\nDoctor:  Great  to  see  you  again.  Lets  review  your  recovery  and  any  concerns  in  our  next  session.\n\nWell also evaluate your next steps with the oncology team.

Youve received some treatment from a local hospital, is\n\nthat right?\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, thats correct. I had those symptoms, and I took medication from the local hospital. But it didnt\n\nseem to improve much.\n\nDoctor:\n\nAlright, Ill review your history. You were feeling fine around 30 days ago, but then these symptoms\n\nstarted.  You  had  an  ultrasound  of  your  abdomen  which  showed  a  hepatic  nodule  and  a  dilated\n\nportal vein. We also did some tests for Hepatitis C and B. Your Hepatitis C test came back negative,\n\nand though one of your reports showed Hepatitis B as positive, the latest PCR test for Hepatitis B\n\nfrom Aga Khan showed \"not detected.\" Have you been on any treatment for these conditions?\n\nPatient:\n\nNo, I havent been on any treatment before.\n\nDoctor:\n\nUnderstood. Lets move on to your review of symptoms. You have not had hematemesis, ascites, or\n\njaundice, which are good signs. Theres no history of significant weight loss, and you haven't needed\n\n\fblood transfusions. Also, no fever or night sweats, correct?\n\nPatient:\n\nThats right. I havent had any of those symptoms.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThats  reassuring.  Now,  Im  going  to  review  your  past  medical  and  surgical  history.  Youve  had  a\n\nhysterectomy two years ago, but there are no other significant medical issues or allergies.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, the hysterectomy was two years ago. No other health issues.\n\nDoctor:\n\nAlright. Lets move on to your family history. You mentioned that you have a history of diabetes and\n\nhypertension in your family. Is that correct?\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, both my parents had diabetes and hypertension.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThanks for sharing that. Now, regarding your social and psychological history, it looks like theres no\n\nhistory  of  depression,  suicidal  thoughts,  or  self-harm.  Youre  a  housewife  and  have  one  daughter.\n\nYou  do  not  have  any  addictions  to  smoking,  alcohol,  or  other  substances.  There  are  also  no\n\nreligious or cultural needs we need to consider, and no financial or educational issues reported.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, thats correct.\n\n\fDoctor:\n\nOn your physical exam, youre conscious and well-oriented with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15. Your\n\nheart  sounds  are  normal,  and  theres  no  tenderness  or  distention  in  your  abdomen.  Now,  let's  go\n\nover your investigations. Your ultrasound on 4th September showed a hepatic nodule, coarse liver,\n\nand dilated portal vein. We did a CT scan on 7th September, and it showed an ill-defined lesion in\n\nyour left hepatic lobe. The lesion was 5.8 x 4.7 x 5.9 cm, with peripheral enhancement and a central\n\nnecrotic  component.  There  was  also  a  hepatic  cyst  and  some  small  abdominal  and  mediastinal\n\nlymphadenopathy, but no pulmonary or osseous metastases.\n\nPatient:\n\nThat sounds serious. What does it mean?\n\nDoctor:\n\nIt  indicates  a  significant  abnormality  in  the  liver,  and  based  on  your  biopsy  results  from  21st\n\nSeptember,  the  lesion  is  a  poorly  differentiated  carcinoma,  which  means  its  a  type  of  cancer.  We\n\nalso performed lab tests, and your MELD score is 6, which indicates a relatively better liver function.\n\nYour AFP levels were normal, but we will continue monitoring them closely.\n\nPatient:\n\nI see. Whats the next step?\n\nDoctor:\n\nYour case was discussed in the multidisciplinary team meeting on 15th October. Given the lesions\n\nlocation and size, were considering a left lateral segmentectomy, which is a surgery to remove part\n\nof the liver. We will need to do more tests, such as blood group and serum electrolytes, and review\n\nthe CT scan from PKLI.\n\n\fPatient:\n\nOkay, I understand. What should I do now?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWe  will  proceed  with  the  necessary  tests,  and  once  the  team  meets  again,  we  will  have  a  clearer\n\nplan. Please follow up after the MDT discussion.\n\nFollow-up Visit (21st October 2024)\n\nDoctor:\n\nGood to see you back. How have you been feeling since our last visit?\n\nPatient:\n\nIve been alright, no major issues, but I still have some pain in my abdomen.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI  see.  Your  recent  tests,  including  your  ultrasound,  show  that  the  liver  lesion  is  still  present,  and\n\ntheres some collection of fluid near the surgical site. The histopathology report confirmed invasive\n\ncarcinoma at the margin of the tumor. Your tumor has a size of 6.4 x 4.2 cm, and its classified as\n\npT1b, which means its a solitary tumor without vascular invasion.\n\nPatient:\n\nSo, what does this mean for my treatment?\n\nDoctor:\n\nGiven that the tumor was found at the margin and is invasive, were going to start chemotherapy with\n\n\fSorafenib.  Youll  need  to  take  200  mg  twice  a  day.  Im  also  prescribing  some  medications  for  your\n\ngeneral  health,  like  Surbex  and  Omeprazole  for  any  acidity.  Youll  also  need  Ispaghol  husk  for\n\nconstipation.\n\nPatient:\n\nI understand. When do I start the chemotherapy?\n\nDoctor:\n\nYou should start the chemotherapy a week after this visit. We will closely monitor your progress, and\n\nI want you to follow up after you begin the treatment.\n\nFollow-up Visit After Surgery (29th November 2024)\n\nDoctor:\n\nHow are you feeling today?\n\nPatient:\n\nI have some pain in my right leg and at the surgical site.\n\nDoctor:\n\nOn examination, your wound is healing well, and the staples have been removed. Your ultrasound\n\nshows some fluid collection at the surgical site, but it's being partially organized, which is expected\n\nafter surgery. We also noted some pleural effusion on the left side, but it's not alarming at this stage.\n\nPatient:\n\nI see. Is that normal after surgery?\n\n\fDoctor:\n\nYes,  thats  quite  common.  Regarding  your  histopathology  report,  it  confirms  that  theres  invasive\n\ncarcinoma  at  the  margin  of  the  liver  tumor,  but  its  still  in  the  early  stages,  classified  as  pT1b  with\n\ngrade  G2.  That  means  were  dealing  with  a  manageable  situation,  but  we  need  to  proceed  with\n\nchemotherapy to ensure it doesn't progress.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhat will happen next?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWe  will  begin  the  chemotherapy  with  Sorafenib  as  planned,  and  Ill  continue  to  monitor  your  lab\n\nresults  closely.  Your  next  steps  will  include  regular  follow-ups  and  any  necessary  adjustments  to\n\nyour treatment based on how you're responding.\n\nLab Results (28th November 2024):\n\nTotal-BILI: 0.25\n\nDirect-BILI: 0.09\n\nALT/AST: 27/29\n\nAlk. Phos.: 100\n\nAlbumin: 4.26\n\nCreatinine: 0.78\n\n\fNa+: 139\n\nK+: 4.33\n\nINR: -\n\nDoctor:\n\nYour lab results are improving, and well continue to monitor your liver function closely. Keep up with\n\nthe prescribed medications, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns.\n\nPatient:\n\nThank you, doctor. Ill follow the treatment plan and let you know if anything changes.\n\n\f",

And Ive also developed jaundice.\n\nDoctor: I see. When exactly did the jaundice start?\n\nPatient: It started around the same time as the pain  so, about a month ago.\n\nDoctor: Understood. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?\n\nPatient: Yes, Ive lost around 10 kilograms in just the past 1 to 2 months.\n\nDoctor: Thats quite significant. Well keep that in mind. Your viral markers came back negative as of\n\n27th June. Thats good to know. Do you have any other symptoms?\n\nPatient: No, just the pain and jaundice.\n\nDoctor: Okay. On your current medications  are you taking anything regularly?\n\nPatient: Just some painkillers, whenever I really need them.\n\n\fDoctor: Alright. Lets talk a bit about your lifestyle and background. Are there any financial difficulties\n\nyou're facing right now?\n\nPatient: Yes, there are some financial strains.\n\nDoctor: Whats your occupation?\n\nPatient: I work as a laborer.\n\nDoctor: And your marital status?\n\nPatient: Im married.\n\nDoctor: Any addictions  smoking, alcohol, tobacco?\n\nPatient: I used to smoke a pack a day for the past 10 years, but I quit 3 months ago.\n\nDoctor:  Thats  a  positive  step.  Do  you  have  any  family  history  of  diabetes,  high  blood  pressure,\n\ncancer, tuberculosis, asthma, or anything else?\n\nPatient: No, nothing significant.\n\nDoctor: Good. Just a few more questions. Do you ever feel depressed?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nDoctor: Any suicidal thoughts?\n\n\fPatient: Never.\n\nDoctor: Any history of self-harm or wishing to die?\n\nPatient: No, nothing like that.\n\nDoctor: From a spiritual or religious point of view, do you have any specific practices or needs we\n\nshould be aware of during your care?\n\nPatient: No, none.\n\nDoctor: And do you have any limitations in communication  language, speech, vision, mobility?\n\nPatient: No, I can communicate fine. No impairments at all.\n\nDoctor: Thank you. Lets do a quick systemic examination. Youre conscious, well-oriented, and your\n\nGlasgow Coma Scale score is 15/15. Your heart sounds  S1 and S2  are normal. Lungs are clear\n\nwith normal vesicular breath sounds. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and not distended.\n\nDoctor:  Based  on  all  this  and  your  imaging/workup,  it  appears  that  were  dealing  with  a  Klatskin\n\ntumor.  Were  suspecting  a  Bismuth  Type  IV  tumor  with  vascular  involvement,  affecting  both  the\n\nhepatic artery and portal vein.\n\nPatient: What does that mean for treatment?\n\nDoctor:  Well  need  urgent  ERCP  (Endoscopic  Retrograde  Cholangiopancreatography) \n\nfor\n\n\fdecompression. After that, well refer you to Dr. Ahmed Kareem, and also to oncology for potential\n\npalliative chemotherapy.\n\nPatient: Okay, I understand.\n\nDoctor: Weve provided education about your diagnosis and what to expect. Lets move ahead with\n\nscheduling the ERCP procedure as soon as possible.\n\nDate: 19-Jul-24 | Post ERCP Discussion\n\nDoctor:  Hello,  weve  completed  your  ERCP  procedure  today.  Everything  went  smoothly,  and  weve\n\ndocumented all the steps.\n\nPatient: What exactly did you do during the procedure?\n\nDoctor: First, we obtained your consent. You were placed in the prone position, and the scope was\n\npassed through your mouth down to the duodenum. Your vitals and oxygen levels were monitored\n\nthroughout. You were under deep sedation, and thankfully, there were no immediate complications.\n\nPatient: Thats a relief.\n\nDoctor: The ERCP findings included a protruding ampulla, and it was a bit challenging to cannulate\n\nthe  common  bile  duct  (CBD).  The  guide  wire  initially  entered  the  pancreatic  duct  (PD)  twice,  but\n\neventually, we achieved selective cannulation of the CBD after performing a needle-knife precut and\n\nbiliary sphincterotomy.\n\nDoctor:  We  inserted  two  guidewires    one  each  into  the  right  and  left  ductal  systems.  The\n\n\fcholangiogram  revealed  a  tight  stricture  that  extended  from  the  mid  and  proximal  CBD  up  to  the\n\ncommon hepatic duct and confluence, along with dilated intrahepatic ducts (IHDs).\n\nPatient: Did you take any samples?\n\nDoctor: Yes, we obtained 40 passes for brushing cytology to examine under the microscope. Then\n\nwe dilated both the right and left ductal strictures using an 8.5 Fr Sohendra dilator.\n\nDoctor:  Two  plastic  biliary  stents  (PBS)  were  placed    a  7  Fr  x  12  cm  stent  in  the  right  hepatic\n\nsystem,  and  a  7  Fr  x  15  cm  stent  in  the  left  hepatic  system,  both  of  which  provided  excellent\n\ndrainage.\n\nPatient: Anything I should be concerned about?\n\nDoctor:  During  the  placement  of  the  second  stent,  the  left-sided  stent  migrated  proximally,  but  it's\n\nsomething were keeping an eye on.\n\nDoctor: For now, your post-procedure plan includes:\n\nNothing by mouth (NPO) for the next 4 hours.\n\nMonitor your vitals every hour for 4 hours.\n\nAdminister Ringer Lactate 500 ml IV over 4 hours.\n\nStart Tablet Ciproxin 500 mg, twice daily, for 5 days.\n\n\fDoctor:  If  you  remain  stable,  well  discharge  you  home  soon.  Please  return  for  a  follow-up  in  2\n\nweeks, and dont forget to bring fresh liver function tests (LFTs) for the next visit.\n\nPatient: Got it, doctor. Thank you for the explanation.\n\nDoctor:  Youre  welcome.  The  procedure  was  performed  by  Dr.  Usman  Aujla,  who  is  a  Consultant\n\nGastroenterologist and Hepatologist (FRCP, UK). Well continue to guide your care step by step.\n\n\f",

I\n\nalso have a history of ischemic heart disease and underwent a PCI four years ago.\"\n\nDoctor:  \"I  see.  Lets  review  your  recent  diagnostic  results.  Your  CT  scan  from  July  31st  shows\n\ndilated intrahepatic biliary channels and a dilated common bile duct (CBD) of 16mm. An MRCP from\n\nAugust  3rd  reveals  a  30  x  20mm  mass  in  the  region  of  the  ampulla  of  Vater,  causing  significant\n\nproximal biliary dilatation, along with a dilated CBD and intrahepatic biliary channels.\"\n\nPatient: \"Yes, Ive been having some discomfort in my abdomen too.\"\n\nDoctor:  \"Thats  consistent  with  the  findings.  On  August  9th,  an  ERCP  was  performed,  but  they\n\ncouldnt cannulate the CBD. An EUS on August 10th identified a 2.1 x 2.5 cm hypoechoic mass in\n\nthe pancreatic head, which is causing retrograde dilatation of the CBD. A biopsy was done, and it\n\ncame back as moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.\"\n\nPatient: \"That sounds serious. What should I expect next?\"\n\nDoctor:  \"Yes,  it  is  serious.  Based  on  the  biopsy  results,  we  have  confirmed  a  periampullary\n\ncarcinoma.  Ive  reviewed  your  labs  as  well.  Your  hemoglobin  is  13,  white  blood  cells  at  9.3,  and\n\nplatelets  are  at  313.  Your  total  bilirubin  is  elevated  at  21.8,  which  aligns  with  the  jaundice.  Liver\n\n\fenzymes  ALT  and  AST  are  both  slightly  elevated  at  81  and  90,  respectively,  and  your  alkaline\n\nphosphatase is quite high at 390. Your creatinine is normal at 0.8, and electrolytes are within range.\"\n\nPatient: \"Im taking some medications for my heart condition as well. Can you explain what needs to\n\nbe done?\"\n\nDoctor:  \"Youre  on  Omeprazole,  Cetrizine,  and  medications  for  your  ischemic  heart  disease.  For\n\nnow, we need to proceed with ERCP to attempt stenting of the CBD to relieve the obstruction. You\n\nwill also be referred to hepatobiliary surgery for further management and to oncology for treatment\n\nplanning. Ill arrange for a follow-up with Dr. Aujla to discuss the ERCP procedure.\"\n\nPatient-Doctor Conversation (Follow-Up Visit)\n\nPatient: \"Im back for a follow-up visit. Im still struggling with the jaundice and itching. Has there been\n\nany progress?\"\n\nDoctor:  \"Yes,  let's  review  everything.  Your  condition  remains  largely  the  same.  The  CT  scan  from\n\nJuly  31st  showed  the  dilated  biliary  system,  and  the  MRCP  revealed  the  mass  in  the  ampulla  of\n\nVater.  The  biopsy  confirmed  that  you  have  moderately  differentiated  pancreatic  adenocarcinoma.\n\nWe attempted the ERCP on August 9th, but it was unsuccessful in cannulating the CBD. On August\n\n10th, the EUS showed the mass in the pancreatic head causing biliary dilatation.\"\n\nPatient: \"What about my lab results? I know the bilirubin is high.\"\n\nDoctor: \"Correct. Your bilirubin was high at 21.8. Let me confirm that. On the most recent labs from\n\nAugust 7th, your hemoglobin was 13, and white blood cell count was 9.3. Your liver enzymes were\n\nelevated,  with  ALT  at  81  and  AST  at  90,  while  alkaline  phosphatase  was  at  390.  Everything  else,\n\n\flike  creatinine  and  albumin,  was  within  normal  ranges.  Your  viral  markers,  including  HCV  and\n\nHBsAg, were negative.\"\n\nPatient: \"Whats the next step in my treatment plan?\"\n\nDoctor: \"For the next steps, were planning a multidisciplinary team discussion on Friday, September\n\n19th, to review your case. Well also need some fresh lab work before that meeting. We are moving\n\nforward  with  your  treatment  and  discussing  the  potential  for  a  Whipples  procedure,  which  will  be\n\nyour only curative option. We are aiming to proceed with the ERCP as previously planned on August\n\n28th to help manage your bile duct obstruction.\"\n\nPatient-Doctor Conversation (After ERCP and Further Discussion)\n\nPatient: \"I had the ERCP performed on August 30th. Can you explain what happened?\"\n\nDoctor:  \"Yes,  we  performed  the  ERCP  on  August  30th.  The  procedure  revealed  Situs  inversus\n\ntotalis, meaning that your internal organs are mirrored. We also found a bulky, infiltrative ampulla, so\n\nwe did a limited sphincterotomy. The cholangiogram showed a rotational anatomy and a short distal\n\nCBD stricture. The CBD and intrahepatic biliary system were massively dilated. We placed a stent,\n\nand drainage was excellent.\"\n\nPatient: \"I still feel some discomfort. What does my lab work show after the procedure?\"\n\nDoctor:  \"Your  recent  labs  show  some  improvement.  Pre-ERCP,  your  total  bilirubin  was  36.18,  but\n\nafter the procedure, it has dropped to 10.8. Your direct bilirubin was 7.6 post-procedure. Your ALT\n\nand AST are now slightly elevated at 105 and 110, respectively, and alkaline phosphatase is 449.\n\nYour albumin level has dropped from 3.65 to 2.1, which we will monitor closely.\"\n\n\fPatient: \"Whats the plan going forward?\"\n\nDoctor:  \"We  had  an  MDT  discussion  on  August  29th  and  confirmed  your  diagnosis  of  pancreatic\n\nadenocarcinoma with Situs inversus totalis. The plan is to refer you for the Whipples procedure. We\n\nwill start you on adjuvant chemotherapy a month after the surgery to help prevent recurrence.\"\n\nPatient: \"I understand. What are the risks of the surgery?\"\n\nDoctor: \"The surgery carries a 5-10% risk of mortality and a 20% risk of morbidity. However, weve\n\nexplained  everything  to  you,  and  you  seem  to  understand  and  are  willing  to  proceed  with  the\n\nsurgery. Ill have Mr. Asif, the coordinator, schedule your surgery for next week. You will be prepared\n\nfor the procedure, and we will continue to monitor your progress.\"\n\n\f",

Ive been having on-and-off pain in my right hypochondrium for about a year now. It's\n\nnot very intense, but it has been persistent.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI see, Mr. Ashraf. How would you describe the pain? And has it been affecting your daily activities?\n\nPatient:\n\nThe  pain  comes  and  goes.  Its  mild,  but  I  do  feel  discomfort,  especially  after  meals.  It  doesn't\n\ncompletely interfere with my routine, but its worrying.\n\nDoctor:\n\nUnderstood. Well need to explore this further. I'll review your recent tests and discuss your medical\n\nhistory  to  get  a  clearer  picture.  Have  you  noticed  any  other  symptoms,  like  weight  loss,  fever,  or\n\nfatigue?\n\nPatient:\n\nNo weight loss or fever, Doctor. Ive also never had any blood transfusions.\n\nDoctor:\n\nGood. That helps rule out a few things. You mentioned that youve had some abdominal ultrasounds\n\nand  blood  tests  in  the  past.  Lets  go  over  those  results.  Your  ultrasound  from  May  shows  an\n\n\fenlarged,  fatty  liver  and  some  cholilithiasis,  which  means  gallstones.  It  also  highlights  significant\n\nintrahepatic biliary dilatation and a somewhat dilated common bile duct.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, the doctors mentioned that the bile ducts were dilated. What does that mean?\n\nDoctor:\n\nThe  dilation  of  the  bile  ducts  could  suggest  a  blockage  or  obstruction,  often  due  to  stones  or  a\n\ntumor. In your case, there is a possibility of a Klatskin tumor, which is a type of cancer that affects\n\nthe bile ducts. Your MRI and CT scans from May and June further confirm some abnormalities in the\n\nbiliary  system,  including  a  stricture  at  the  bile  duct  junction,  which  is  concerning  for  a  malignant\n\ngrowth.\n\nPatient:\n\nIs it cancer, Doctor?\n\nDoctor:\n\nIts  still  too  early  to  make  that  determination.  However,  the  possibility  of  cholangiocarcinoma,  a\n\ncancer of the bile ducts, is something we need to consider seriously. Your liver function tests show\n\nsome abnormal results, like elevated ALP levels, which are often seen in biliary diseases.\n\nPatient:\n\nI see. What steps do we need to take next?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWere  going  to  take  a  few  more  measures.  Well  submit  your  CT  and  MRI  images  for  a  detailed\n\nreview. Additionally, I recommend a biopsy via ERCP, where we can obtain a sample from the bile\n\n\fducts  to  confirm  whether  theres  malignancy.  We'll  also  monitor  the  CA19-9  tumor  marker,  which\n\ncould give us more insight.\n\nPatient:\n\nWill the ERCP be painful?\n\nDoctor:\n\nIts a minimally invasive procedure, but youll be under sedation so it should be relatively comfortable.\n\nThe goal is to collect a tissue sample from the area of concern.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhats the prognosis if it turns out to be cancer?\n\nDoctor:\n\nIf its confirmed as cholangiocarcinoma, we will explore treatment options. However, its important to\n\nnote  that,  based  on  current  imaging,  your  condition  appears  to  be  locally  advanced,  and  surgery\n\nmay  not  be  an  option.  We  would  then  refer  you  to  oncology  for  further  management,  which  may\n\ninclude chemotherapy or other palliative treatments.\n\nPatient:\n\nThat sounds like a lot, Doctor. How soon can we proceed with these tests?\n\nDoctor:\n\nI understand this is overwhelming, but we will proceed step by step. Ive already arranged for you to\n\nhave an ERCP, and well also do a follow-up in a few days to discuss the results. Meanwhile, well\n\nkeep an eye on your liver function through regular tests.\n\n\fPatient:\n\nThank you, Doctor. Ill follow your advice.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYoure  welcome.  Well  be  here  to  support  you  through  each  step.  Lets  take  it  one  day  at  a  time.\n\nPlease dont hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns in the meantime.\n\nFollow-Up Visit (16/08/24):\n\nDoctor:\n\nGood to see you again, Mr. Ashraf. How have you been feeling since your last visit?\n\nPatient:\n\nThe pain in my right hypochondrium is still there. It's been on and off, but I feel a bit weaker now. Im\n\nworried about whats going on.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI  understand  your  concern.  Lets  go  over  your  latest  tests.  We  recently  did  an  ERCP  and\n\nhistopathology  of  the  bile  duct.  The  results  came  back  with  benign  ductal  epithelial  cells,  and  no\n\nmalignant cells were found. This suggests that the stricture in your bile duct may not be cancerous.\n\nPatient:\n\nThats a relief to hear, Doctor. But what does it mean for me now?\n\nDoctor:\n\nIts  good  news,  but  we  still  need  to  stay  vigilant.  The  ERCP  revealed  a  stricture  at  the  bile  duct\n\njunction  with  dilation,  which  could  be  related  to  benign  or  inflammatory  causes.  Well  continue\n\n\fmonitoring your condition closely. Based on the ERCP findings and histopathology, we dont suspect\n\nmalignancy at this time, but we will keep checking.\n\nPatient:\n\nDo I need any further treatments?\n\nDoctor:\n\nFor now, the plan is to continue with conservative management. Well monitor your liver function and\n\ndo  further  imaging  if  needed.  Well  also  keep  following  up  with  oncology  in  case  any  treatment  is\n\nnecessary. Your lab results are improving slightly, which is a positive sign.\n\nPatient:\n\nThank you for explaining, Doctor. I feel a bit better after hearing that. Whats the next step?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWell schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor your condition and make sure your symptoms dont\n\nworsen.  Keep  track  of  any  new  or  worsening  symptoms  and  let  us  know  immediately.  Well  also\n\nreview your test results regularly and make adjustments to your care as needed.\n\nPatient:\n\nI will, Doctor. Thanks for everything.\n\n\f",

Its peak systolic velocity (PSV) is 69\n\ncm/sec, and the resistance index (RI) is 0.64. The portal vein is patent with antegrade flow, and the\n\nvelocities at various points are 29 cm/sec at the pre-anastomotic site, 89 cm/sec at the anastomotic\n\nsite, and 41 cm/sec post-anastomosis.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhats the situation with the hepatic veins?\n\nDoctor:\n\nThe  hepatic  veins  also  show  antegrade  flow,  with  a  triphasic  flow  in  the  right  hepatic  vein,  and\n\npatchy monophasic flow in segment VIII.\n\nPatient:\n\nAnd what did the histopathology report show for the explanted liver?\n\nDoctor:\n\nIt showed two moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas, both around 1.6 cm and 1.8 cm.\n\nFortunately, there was no vascular invasion, and the tumor margins are free of cancer. The liver also\n\nshows  regenerative  nodules,  chronic  hepatitis  due  to  HCV,  and  cirrhosis.  The  gallbladder  had\n\ncholesterosis but was free of carcinoma.\n\nPatient:\n\nThat's reassuring. Is there anything else noteworthy?\n\nDoctor:\n\nYes, there was some portal vein thrombus in the portal vein wall, but no tumor was found.\n\n\fPatient:\n\nThanks, doctor. Whats the next step in my treatment?\n\nDoctor:\n\nIve adjusted your medications:\n\nIve decreased your prednisolone to 15mg once daily.\n\nDecreased fluconazole to 150mg once daily.\n\nIncreased tacrolimus to 2mg twice daily.\n\nDiscontinued  some  medications  like  polyethyleneglycol,  paracetamol,  tramadol,  domperidone,\n\ncefixime, and vancomycin.\n\nWell keep monitoring your progress with follow-up visits.\n\nPatient:\n\nHello, doctor. Im back for my next follow-up visit. Its been 24 days since surgery.\n\nDoctor:\n\nWelcome back. How are you feeling today? Any issues?\n\nPatient:\n\nIve  been  having  some  abdominal  pain,  constipation,  and  a  bit  of  parasthesia  in  the  palms  of  my\n\nhands.\n\n\fDoctor:\n\nWell  need  to  monitor  that.  Let  me  check  the  wound.  It  appears  healed,  and  the  hernia  repair  site\n\nlooks  good.  Your  labs  and  medications  are  updated  in  the  file,  and  well  keep  an  eye  on  the\n\nchanges.\n\nFor your tacrolimus, we increased the dose to 2mg twice a day in the last visit. Ill order a doppler\n\nultrasound of the abdomen for today, and you can come to the clinic afterward.\n\nPatient:\n\nThanks, doctor.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThe ultrasound was reviewed by Dr. Yasir Khan, and the plan is to reduce your tacrolimus to 1mg\n\ntwice daily. We'll follow up after one week, and also remove two of your stitches.\n\nPatient:\n\nIm back for another follow-up. Its been a month since my surgery now.\n\nDoctor:\n\nWelcome back. Any concerns today?\n\nPatient:\n\nJust some mild pain at the wound suture site. There's one stitch at the hernia repair site thats still\n\nbothering me.\n\nDoctor:\n\nUnderstood.  Well  monitor  that  closely.  Your  labs  and  medications  are  up  to  date.  For  now,  Ive\n\n\fdecided to discontinue fluconazole and aspirin. Lets schedule another follow-up in two weeks, and\n\nplease come in with fresh labs.\n\nPatient:\n\nHello again, doctor. Its been 46 days since the surgery.\n\nDoctor:\n\nHow are you feeling today?\n\nPatient:\n\nNo issues right now. Everything seems good.\n\nDoctor:\n\nIm  happy  to  hear  that.  Your  labs  and  medications  are  on  file,  and  based  on  todays  review,  Im\n\nincreasing your tacrolimus dose to 1.5mg + 1mg twice daily. Im also increasing your prednisolone to\n\n10mg once daily. Well follow up in two weeks. For any pain, use Nuberol Forte twice a day for five\n\ndays.\n\nPatient:\n\nIm back for the next check-up, doctor. Its been 53 days since my surgery.\n\nDoctor:\n\nHow are you doing?\n\nPatient:\n\nNo major issues, just following up as instructed.\n\n\fDoctor:\n\nYour tacrolimus level is at 6.25 today. Heres your medication plan:\n\nTacrolimus 1.5mg + 1mg daily.\n\nSeptran once daily on alternate days.\n\nDeltacortel 10mg once daily.\n\nQalsan daily once daily.\n\nSurbex Z once daily.\n\nFamotidine 40mg once daily.\n\nNuberol Forte twice daily.\n\nSofosbuvir + Velpatasvir 400/100mg once daily for 3 months.\n\nWe'll  monitor  your  condition  and  see  you  in  a  week.  Im  also  planning  to  increase  your  tacrolimus\n\nlevel  to  1.5mg  twice  daily  and  introduce  Ursodeoxycholic  acid  250mg  three  times  a  day.  Well  get\n\nfresh labs at that time.\n\nPatient:\n\nIts been two months since surgery. Im here for my next visit.\n\nDoctor:\n\n\fGlad to see you. How have you been?\n\nPatient:\n\nIm doing well. No issues, my abdomen feels soft and non-tender, and the wound has healed with a\n\nscar.\n\nDoctor:\n\nGood  to  hear.  The  histopathology  report  shows  no  further  issues,  and  your  RETREAT  score  is  1.\n\nWeve updated your medication plan:\n\nDecrease Tacrolimus to 1mg twice daily.\n\nDecrease Deltacortil to 5mg once daily.\n\nStop Nuberol Forte and Ursodeoxycholic acid.\n\nWell also schedule a CT scan and AFP on postoperative day 4 months.\n\nPatient:\n\nIm here for my 3-month follow-up.\n\nDoctor:\n\nHow are you doing today?\n\nPatient:\n\nNo complaints. My abdomen is soft, and the wound has healed. The scar is present.\n\nDoctor:\n\n\fIve reviewed your labs and theyre looking good. Heres the updated plan:\n\nStart Mycophenolate mofetil 1 gram twice daily.\n\nPrednisolone 10mg once daily.\n\nWell schedule a CT scan and AFP in two months.\n\nFollow up after three weeks, and well continue monitoring your progress.\n\nPatient:\n\nThank you, doctor.\n\nYou said:\n\nDont put lines in between\n\nChatGPT said:\n\nSure! Here's the conversation formatted as requested:\n\nDoctor: Good morning! How are you feeling today?\n\n\fPatient:  Good  morning,  Doctor.  Im  feeling  alright.  Im  here  for  my  follow-up  visit  after  the  liver\n\ntransplant and hernia repair surgery.\n\nDoctor:  Great  to  hear  you're  doing  alright.  Lets  go  over  everything.  You  had  a  living  donor  liver\n\ntransplant (LDLT) along with an umbilical hernia repair on 2nd December. You were discharged on\n\n14th December, and this is your first follow-up visit, which is 16 days post-surgery.\n\nPatient: Yes, thats right. Ive had minimal issues, but I noticed some mild abdominal discomfort now\n\nand then.\n\nDoctor:  Noted.  Your  active  issues  currently  are  nil.  Your  bag  output  has  been  minimal  since\n\ndischarge,  which  is  good.  I  have  reviewed  your  ultrasound  from  17th  December.  Heres  what  we\n\nfound:\n\nThe transplanted liver shows a normal parenchymal echotexture with smooth margins. No focal liver\n\nlesions  were  seen,  and  there  is  no  intra  or  extrahepatic  biliary  dilatation.  You  also  have  minimal\n\nbilateral  pleural  effusion  and  minimal  to  mild  abdominopelvic  ascites,  which  well  continue\n\nmonitoring.\n\nAs for the vascular structures, the hepatic artery shows antegrade flow, and the portal vein is patent\n\nwith antegrade flow as well. Theres a slight patchy monophasic flow in the hepatic veins. This is all\n\nbeing managed, and nothing seems concerning at this point.\n\nPatient: Thats a relief. I also remember they removed my gallbladder during the surgery, right?\n\nDoctor:  Yes,  thats  correct.  The  histopathology  from  the  explanted  liver  shows  two  moderately\n\ndifferentiated hepatocellular carcinomas, both with no vascular invasion. Your liver also had chronic\n\n\fhepatitis due to HCV and cirrhosis. The gallbladder had cholestherosis but was free from carcinoma.\n\nPatient: It sounds like everything is under control. What about my medication?\n\nDoctor: Based on your progress, Im reducing the dose of your prednisolone to 15 mg once daily and\n\nfluconazole to 150 mg once daily. Im also increasing your tacrolimus to 2 mg twice a day. Please\n\ndiscontinue polyethylene glycol, paracetamol, tramadol, domperidone, cefixime, and vancomycin.\n\nPatient: Okay, Ill make those changes. Whats next for me?\n\nDoctor:  Your  next  ultrasound  and  labs  will  be  reviewed  at  your  next  follow-up.  Well  continue  to\n\nmonitor your progress closely.\n\nDoctor: Good afternoon! How have you been since your last visit?\n\nPatient: Good afternoon, Doctor. Ive had a few new issues. I've been experiencing some abdominal\n\npain, constipation, and tingling in the palms of my hands.\n\nDoctor: I see. During your examination today, your wound appeared healed, and the hernia repair\n\nsite  looks  good.  Your  active  issues  are  being  addressed.  You  had  an  ultrasound  Doppler  of  the\n\nabdomen today as part of your follow-up. How are you feeling now?\n\nPatient: Ive been feeling a bit better, though the abdominal pain persists a little. I also noticed some\n\nchanges in my hands.\n\nDoctor:  Well  continue  to  monitor  your  liver  function  and  medication.  Your  tacrolimus  dose  was\n\nincreased to 2 mg twice a day at your last visit. We will now adjust it back to 1 mg twice daily and\n\n\fcontinue to keep an eye on your progress.\n\nPatient: Sounds good. What should I do next?\n\nDoctor: Ill see you in a week, and well take out two stitches as part of your follow-up. Make sure to\n\ncome back for your check-up with fresh labs and reports.\n\nDoctor: Hi there! How are you doing now?\n\nPatient: Im doing okay, but theres still mild pain at the suture site from the hernia repair.\n\nDoctor:  Alright,  well  continue  to  monitor  that.  Your  active  issues  right  now  seem  minimal.  Weve\n\nalready reduced the medications slightly since last time. Your tacrolimus dose will be adjusted as we\n\ndiscussed, and your labs will be updated at the next visit.\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me.\n\nDoctor: I will discontinue fluconazole and aspirin as planned. Lets schedule your next follow-up for\n\ntwo weeks from now, and well do a fresh set of labs.\n\nDoctor: Welcome back. How have things been going since your last visit?\n\nPatient: Things have been going alright, Doctor. No new issues to report.\n\nDoctor:  Excellent!  It  seems  your  liver  function  is  stable.  During  todays  visit,  well  be  adjusting  your\n\ntacrolimus  and  prednisolone  doses.  Well  also  ensure  you  continue  on  your  current  medication\n\nregimen.\n\n\fPatient: Okay, Im ready for any adjustments. Lets continue with the plan.\n\nDoctor:  Your  tacrolimus  dose  will  be  increased  to  1.5  mg  in  the  morning  and  1  mg  at  night.\n\nPrednisolone will be increased to 10 mg once daily. For now, well add Nuberol Forte twice a day for\n\nthe next 5 days for any lingering discomfort.\n\nPatient: Understood. Ill stick to the changes.\n\nDoctor: Ill see you in two weeks, and well monitor everything closely.\n\nDoctor: How have you been feeling since your last visit?\n\nPatient: Im feeling pretty good, no significant issues. The abdominal pain seems to be resolving.\n\nDoctor: That's great to hear. Your tacrolimus dose will be adjusted to 1.5 mg twice daily. Well add\n\nUrso  (Ursodeoxycholic  acid)  250  mg  three  times  a  day  to  help  with  liver  function.  For  now,  youll\n\ncontinue with your current medications, including mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone.\n\nPatient: Got it! Ill follow the new dosage.\n\nDoctor: Well follow up again in a week, and well review everything in your labs.\n\nDoctor: Good to see you today. How are you feeling?\n\nPatient: Im doing well, no active complaints. The wound has healed nicely.\n\n\fDoctor:  Thats  great.  After  reviewing  your  labs  and  progress,  everything  is  on  track.  Your\n\nhistopathology still shows two moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas, but there are no\n\nsigns of any new complications. Im reducing your tacrolimus to 1 mg twice daily, and well stop the\n\nNuberol Forte and Ursodeoxycholic acid for now.\n\nPatient: Alright, Ill stick to the new plan.\n\nDoctor: Perfect! Your CT scan and AFP levels will be done at your 4-month post-op check-up. Keep\n\nup with your medications and follow the new plan. Well see you in a few weeks.\n\nDoctor: How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Im doing okay. Ive been stable overall, and the wound site is completely healed now.\n\nDoctor: Excellent! The histopathology still confirms that everything is stable, and there are no new\n\nconcerns. Your liver transplant is holding up well.\n\nPatient: Thats a relief to hear.\n\nDoctor:  Well  continue  the  current  medication  regimen  for  now  and  check  in  again  in  three  weeks.\n\nYoull need a CT scan and AFP levels in two months.\n\nPatient: Sounds good to me! Ill keep following the plan.\n\nDoctor: Great! Well see you soon, and take care in the meantime.\n\n\f",

Two\n\nweeks  ago,  I  had  an  ERCP  which  led  to  pancreatitis,  but  it's  resolving  now.  I  was  admitted  for\n\npost-ERCP pancreatitis and have come in today for a follow-up to discuss my biopsy report.\"\n\nDoctor: \"Thank you for coming in today. Let's go over your symptoms. You mentioned having some\n\nfever, although it hasn't been documented, along with upper abdominal pain and vomiting since your\n\nadmission. These symptoms persisted even after your discharge, correct?\"\n\nPatient: \"Yes, that's right.\"\n\nDoctor:  \"On  examination,  you  are  a  young  female  with  deep  jaundice  and  noticeable  pallor.  Upon\n\nchecking your abdomen, there is mild tenderness in the epigastric region, but everything else seems\n\nnormal.

    "raw_text": "Gender: Male\n\nAge: 44\n\nMRN: 715245\n\nDiagnosis: Hepatocellular Carcinoma\n\nHistory and Physical:\n\nPatient:\n\nGood morning, Doctor. I'm here for my follow-up.\n\nDoctor:\n\nGood morning. How have you been feeling lately? Any issues or changes since we last saw you?\n\nPatient:\n\nWell, I've been having some upper abdominal pain. It's been bothering me on and off. Also, Ive been\n\nfeeling a bit weak, and Ive noticed some weight loss recently.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI see. Lets review your past medical history. You were diagnosed with Hepatitis C about 10 years\n\nago,  correct?  You  were  treated  with  DAAs  for  six  months  and  achieved  a  sustained  virologic\n\nresponse. Your last PCR test was three years ago, and it came back negative.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, that's correct. Ive been stable with no major issues.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThats  good  to  hear.  Lets  look  at  your  recent  scans  and  labs.  Your  ultrasound  from  December  13,\n\n2022,  shows  a  slightly  cirrhotic  liver  with  multiple  hyperechoic  focal  lesions,  the  largest  measuring\n\n6.4 x 5.1 cm. Mild splenomegaly was noted, but there was no ascites.\n\n\fPatient:\n\nYes, I had that ultrasound done. What does it mean for me?\n\nDoctor:\n\nBased  on  the  CT  scan  from  December  21,  2022,  which  shows  a  slightly  coarse  liver  with  focal\n\nlesions  in  the  right  lobe,  theres  concern  for  a  possible  atypical  hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC)  or\n\nmetastatic  disease.  The  lesions  show  arterialization  and  relative  washout,  which  raises  concern.\n\nYou also have patent portal veins, which is a positive sign.\n\nPatient:\n\nThat sounds serious. Whats the next step?\n\nDoctor:\n\nYoure  right  to  be  concerned.  Well  proceed  with  a  treatment  plan  that  includes  transarterial\n\nchemoembolization  (TACE),  which  targets  the  tumors.  Youll  also  start  taking  Sorafenib,  an  oral\n\nmedication to help manage the HCC. Ive advised you to bring the CD of your CT scan and labs for\n\nfurther review.\n\nPatient:\n\nOkay, Ill bring those in. What about the treatment plan for Sorafenib?\n\nDoctor:\n\nYoull start with Sorafenib at 200 mg twice a day for 10 days, then well increase it to 400 mg twice a\n\nday if you tolerate it well. Also, well continue with Surbex Z once a day and Omeprazole 40 mg once\n\na day.\n\n\fPatient:\n\nGot it. Ill follow those instructions.\n\nPatient:\n\nI had my next visit on January 4, 2023, for a review. My AFP levels were still high at 37,839. The\n\ndoctors mentioned that my CT scan quality was poor, so theyve asked me to repeat it.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYes,  we  reviewed  the  scan  and  noted  the  poor  quality.  We  will  repeat  the  CT  scan  to  get  clearer\n\nimages.  As  for  the  treatment,  well  proceed  with  TACE  and  Sorafenib.  Also,  we  will  need  to  get  a\n\nbiopsy from the left liver lobe.\n\nPatient:\n\nOkay, Ill make sure to follow up on those.\n\nPatient:\n\nI was admitted in January for TACE and liver biopsy. The biopsy showed chronic hepatitis with mild\n\nsteatosis and focal portal fibrous expansion.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYes, Ive noted that. After the TACE procedure on January 28, 2023, you developed transaminitis,\n\nbut  your  liver  function  tests  are  improving.  You  had  fever  spikes,  but  those  seem  to  have  settled\n\nnow.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, I felt feverish for a while, but its better now.\n\n\fDoctor:\n\nGood.  Your  condition  is  stable.  Well  continue  with  your  medication,  including  Omeprazole,\n\nParacetamol,  and  Tramadol  for  pain  relief.  You  had  an  allergic  reaction  to  Tanzo,  so  we  switched\n\nyou to Ceftriaxone, which has been well-tolerated.\n\nPatient:\n\nI remember that. The medication switch helped a lot.\n\nDoctor:\n\nExcellent.  Youll  continue  with  Omeprazole,  Cefixime,  and  Lactulose  after  discharge.  I  also\n\nrecommend taking Nuberol for pain as needed.\n\nPatient:\n\nIll keep that in mind.\n\nDoctor:\n\nFollow-up is important. Well need to chase the liver biopsy report and get cultures. After two weeks,\n\nIll need fresh CBC and liver function tests. In four weeks, well reassess with baseline labs and an\n\nAFP test. A CT triphasic scan will also be done, and if the tumor remains, we may consider re-TACE\n\nor potential resection.\n\nPatient:\n\nUnderstood. Ill make sure to attend the follow-up and get the tests done.\n\nPatient:\n\nOn  March  14,  2023,  I  had  another  visit,  and  my  labs  showed  an  AFP  of  37,839  again.  The  CT\n\ntriphasic  scan  from  March  1st  showed  some  changes  post-TACE,  with  dense  peripheral  lipiodol\n\n\findicating central necrosis and multiple air foci. The previous tumor thrombus in the right portal vein\n\nis  no  longer  enhancing.  Theres  no  evidence  of  new  HCC,  but  some  small  lymph  nodes  remain\n\nunchanged.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThe CT scan results are reassuring in terms of the lack of progression of the tumor. The small lymph\n\nnodes and residual arterialized components will be monitored, but theres no sign of metastasis. We\n\nwill continue with the same treatment plan: TACE and Sorafenib. Well also need a follow-up in four\n\nweeks.\n\nPatient:\n\nThats a relief. Ill continue the treatment as advised.\n\nDoctor:\n\nIve  noted  that  your  latest  labs  from  March  1st  show  a  urea  level  of  12  and  creatinine  of  0.64.  All\n\nother  values  are  stable.  Well  proceed  with  the  MDT  discussion  for  liver  resection  and  continue\n\nmonitoring your condition closely.\n\nPatient:\n\nThank you for the update, Doctor.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYou're welcome. We'll keep a close eye on your progress and adjust the treatment as needed. Make\n\nsure to stay on top of your follow-ups and lab tests.\n\nPatient:\n\nI havent been answering calls from the clinic recently.\n\n\fDoctor:\n\nWeve been trying to reach you. Please make sure to answer the follow-up calls so we can continue\n\nto track your progress.\n\nPatient:\n\nIll do that. Thank you, Doctor.\n\nDoctor:\n\nTake care, and well speak soon.                                                                                                        \n\nPatient: Good morning, doctor. Im here for my follow-up visit.\n\nDoctor: Good morning! Let's go over your current status. I see that you've been dealing with HCV\n\nand angioinvasive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with a transarterial chemoembolization (TACE)\n\nprocedure done back in January. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient:  I've  been  feeling  weak  and  tired.  I  still  have  some  cough  at  night,  but  I  walk  a  kilometer\n\ndaily. However, my overall energy levels are quite low.\n\nDoctor: I see. Its good that youre staying active despite feeling weak. Lets go over your recent tests\n\nand  imaging.  You  had  a  liver  biopsy  on  27th  January,  and  the  histology  showed  chronic  hepatitis\n\nwith  mild  steatosis  and  focal  portal  fibrosis.  The  fibrosis  was  F1/4,  which  indicates  early-stage\n\nfibrosis.\n\nPatient: Yes, I remember the biopsy results. What do they mean for my treatment plan?\n\nDoctor: The biopsy result indicates that your liver is still in relatively early stages of fibrosis, which is\n\n\fgood.  We  can  continue  managing  the  condition  with  systemic  therapies  like  sorafenib.  As  for  the\n\nTACE  procedure  you  had,  I  see  the  post-procedure  CT  scan  shows  that  the  treated  lesion  in  the\n\nright  liver  lobe  is  responding.  The  dense  peripheral  lipiodol  and  the  central  necrosis  suggest  the\n\ntreatment  was  effective,  though  theres  still  a  small  residual  arterialized  component.  The  previous\n\ntumor  thrombus  in  your  right  portal  vein  isnt  showing  enhancement  in  the  latest  scan,  which  is  a\n\npositive sign.\n\nPatient: Thats reassuring. But I know there was a complication with my HCC rupturing in the right\n\nlung parenchyma. How does that change things?\n\nDoctor: Yes, the rupture of the HCC into the lung was an unexpected complication. Unfortunately,\n\nthis  meant  that  the  planned  right  hepatectomy  had  to  be  canceled.  However,  weve  switched  to\n\nsystemic  therapy  with  sorafenib,  and  you're  still  on  that  treatment.  Ill  be  closely  monitoring  your\n\nprogress. Your last CT scan did not show any interval HCC in the rest of your liver parenchyma, and\n\nthe small locoregional lymph nodes are unchanged.\n\nPatient: Thats good news, but what about my lab results? Are there any significant changes?\n\nDoctor: Lets look at your labs from the past few months:\n\nHB (Hemoglobin): It has stayed stable at around 14 to 15.6 g/dL, which is normal.\n\nTLC (Total Leukocyte Count): It was slightly elevated at 7 on 29th December and 14th March, but its\n\nnow 5.5 on 6th June and 6.1 in September, indicating its coming down.\n\nPlatelets  (PLT):  The  platelets  were  quite  high  at  310  in  March,  but  they're  now  at  158,  which  is  a\n\ngood improvement.\n\n\fBilirubin (T-BIL and D-BIL): Your total and direct bilirubin levels are within normal range now, with\n\nthe latest values being 0.21 for T-BIL and 0.12 for D-BIL.\n\nALT/AST: These liver enzymes are within the normal range, though ALT was a bit higher at 59/58 in\n\nSeptember.\n\nALP (Alkaline Phosphatase): This has decreased from 335 to 90, which is a positive change.\n\nAlbumin: It dropped from 4.6 to 3.3 in March but is now up to 4.04 in June and 4.2 in September,\n\nwhich is a sign of improving liver function.\n\nCreatinine: It's stable at 0.6 to 0.67, which is normal for kidney function.\n\nNa+ and K+: Sodium is stable at 128 to 137, and potassium is within range at 4.1 to 4.53.\n\nAFP  (Alpha-Fetoprotein):  This  is  a  critical  marker  for  HCC.  Your  AFP  dropped  significantly  from\n\n37,839 in December to 2,783 in March, and its now down to 3.58 in June and 4.49 in September,\n\nwhich is an excellent sign.\n\nPatient: So, the lab results seem to show some improvement. What about my medications?\n\nDoctor:  Youre  currently  on  sorafenib  200  mg  twice  daily.  I  see  that  youre  also  taking  omeprazole,\n\ntramadol,  and  paracetamol,  which  are  helping  manage  your  symptoms.  In  addition,  your  recent\n\nprescriptions  include  Qalsan  D,  Surbex  Z,  and  lactulose.  Your  current  treatment  plan  looks  good,\n\nand I recommend continuing with sorafenib.\n\n\fPatient: That sounds like a plan. Are there any changes I should be aware of?\n\nDoctor: Well continue to monitor your condition closely. We plan to do a CT scan in three months\n\nand  follow  up  with  more  lab  work,  including  AFP.  If  you  feel  any  new  symptoms  or  changes,  dont\n\nhesitate to reach out.

Along with that,\n\nmy urine has turned dark, my stools are clay-colored, and I feel itchy most of the time. I also have\n\nnausea and Im not eating properly.\n\nDoctor:\n\nWhen did all this start exactly?\n\nPatient:\n\nIt began about two months ago. Before that, I was fine. Then I was told I have something called a\n\nCBD stricture. I had a procedure called an ERCP on the 18th of December. After that, I developed\n\nmild pancreatitis. My amylase was 311. They managed it conservatively.\n\nDoctor:\n\nHave you lost any weight during this time?\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, around 10 kilograms in the last two months.\n\nDoctor:\n\n\fDo you have hepatitis B or C?\n\nPatient:\n\nNo, I was tested and found to be non-reactive for both.\n\nDoctor:\n\nAny history of fever or night sweats?\n\nPatient:\n\nNo, none.\n\nDoctor:\n\nHave you had any previous medical or surgical conditions?\n\nPatient:\n\nNo prior illnesses or surgeries.\n\nDoctor:\n\nAre you taking any medications at the moment?\n\nPatient:\n\nNot  right  now,  but  previously  I  was  taking  Ursodeoxycholic  acid  250  mg  twice  a  day  and\n\nOmeprazole 40 mg once a day.\n\nDoctor:\n\nAny allergies?\n\n\fPatient:\n\nNo allergies.\n\nDoctor:\n\nDo you have any financial concerns or religious/cultural needs for your care?\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, I do have financial issues, but I dont have any special cultural or religious needs.\n\nDoctor:\n\nWhats your occupation?\n\nPatient:\n\nIm a bus driver.\n\nDoctor:\n\nDo you smoke, drink alcohol, or chew tobacco?\n\nPatient:\n\nI used to smoke 30 cigarettes a day but I quit a month ago.\n\nDoctor:\n\nAny family history of diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, TB, or asthma?\n\nPatient:\n\nNo, nothing like that.\n\n\fDoctor:\n\nHave you been feeling depressed or having any suicidal thoughts?\n\nPatient:\n\nNo, nothing like that.\n\nDoctor:\n\nCan you see, speak, walk, and understand clearly?\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, I dont have any impairments.\n\nDoctor (Reviewing Physical Exam):\n\nYoure conscious, alert, and oriented. GCS is 15/15. Your heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear\n\nbilaterally, and your abdomen is soft, non-tender, and not distended.\n\nDoctor (Reviewing Imaging):\n\nOn  17th  December,  your  ultrasound  showed  a  dilated  CBD  up  to  10  mm  and  intra/extrahepatic\n\ncholestasis, with an abrupt change in caliber at the porta hepatis  likely due to a stricture or growth.\n\nThe  ERCP  on  18th  December  revealed  a  stricture  at  the  mid-to-proximal  CBD  junction  with\n\nupstream  biliary  dilation.  A  10  Fr  x  12  cm  plastic  stent  was  placed  across  the  stricture,  and  a\n\nsphincterotomy was done.\n\nA  follow-up  ultrasound  on  21st  December  confirmed  the  stent  placement  and  showed  marked\n\nintrahepatic biliary dilation and early signs of pancreatitis.\n\n\fDoctor (Reviewing CT from 27th December, CMH):\n\nYour liver has cystic lesions, the largest being 2.2 x 2.1 cm in segment V, with hyperenhancement at\n\nthe  rim.  Theres  evidence  of  interstitial  edematous  pancreatitis  with  fluid  collections  extending  into\n\nthe  left  Gerotas  fascia  and  surrounding  areas.  You  also  have  minimal  pleural  effusion  and  some\n\nlung changes.\n\nDoctor (Lab Review):\n\nHere are your labs from 18th and 24th December:\n\nHb: 16.7\n\nWBC: 9.5\n\nPlatelets: 236\n\nTotal Bilirubin: 4.1  15.6\n\nDirect Bilirubin:   13.8\n\nALT/AST: 84  49/74\n\nAlkaline Phosphatase: 542  346\n\nAlbumin:   3.0\n\nCreatinine: 1.1\n\n\fIgG-4: 1160 mg/L\n\nAFP: 2.7 (on 08-Jan-25)\n\nCA19-9: 4.4  417\n\nECOG Performance Status: 01\n\nBMI: 19.23\n\nBlood Group: B+ve\n\nDoctor:\n\nBased on this, we need to get a fresh CT scan and lab results, especially CA19-9 levels. Once we\n\nhave that, well finalize the treatment plan. Please follow up after the investigations.\n\nDate: 06-Feb-2025 | Follow-Up\n\nDoctor:\n\nYou were diagnosed with obstructive jaundice two months ago, and now your provisional diagnosis\n\nis cholangiocarcinoma. Lets review your fresh CT from 29-Jan-25.\n\nDoctor (Reading):\n\nYour  scan  shows  moderate  intrahepatic  biliary  dilatation,  a  CBD  stent  in  place,  and  some\n\npneumobilia. Theres also wall thickening in the biliary channels suggesting cholangitis. Additionally,\n\nyou have acute pancreatitis with a CT severity index of 4 (moderate).\n\n\fDoctor (Lab Results on 29-Jan-25):\n\nHb: 11.9\n\nWBC: 17.4\n\nPlatelets: 659\n\nTotal Bilirubin: 2.26\n\nDirect Bilirubin: 1.81\n\nALT/AST: 130/100\n\nAlkaline Phosphatase: 2145\n\nAlbumin: 3.64\n\nCreatinine: 0.82\n\nNa+: 132\n\nK+: 4.32\n\nINR: 1.05\n\nCA19-9: now down to 279 from 417\n\n\fECOG: 0-1\n\nDoctor:\n\nOur assessment suggests hilar cholangiocarcinoma, possibly extending into the right hepatic ducts.\n\nSurgical  plan  includes  a  Right  hepatectomy  or  Trisectionectomy  with  excision  of  the  biliary  tree,\n\nlymphadenectomy,  and  Roux-en-Y  hepaticojejunostomy.  Chemotherapy  may  follow,  depending  on\n\nhistopathology. Well now coordinate surgery scheduling.\n\nDate: 07-Mar-2025 | 1st Post-op Follow-Up (POD 10)\n\nDoctor:\n\nYou  had  surgery  on  25-Feb-25:  Central  Partial  Hepatectomy  +  Hepaticojejunostomy \n\nfor\n\nCholangiocarcinoma (T2N1Mx). How are you feeling?\n\nPatient:\n\nIm  okay.  The  right  urostomy  bag  hasnt  had  any  output  for  three  days,  but  the  left  drain  has\n\noutputted 210 mL on the first day, and 100 mL per day since.\n\nDoctor (Examining):\n\nYour wound is healing well. Clips are in place, and both drain sites look fine.\n\nDoctor (Reviewing Histopathology):\n\nSegment  IVB  and  V  show  benign  liver  parenchyma  with  marked  portal  edema,  inflammation,\n\ncholangitis, and periductal onion-skin fibrosis, consistent with secondary sclerosing cholangitis.\n\nNo tumor found.\n\n\fLymph  nodes  around  hepatic  artery,  celiac  axis,  and  common  hepatic  artery    all  showed  fibrofatty\n\ntissue with no malignancy.\n\nThe caudate tissue also showed no tumor.\n\n\f",

    "raw_text": "Gender: Female\n\nAge: 60\n\nMRN: 775913\n\nDiagnosis: Cholangiocarcinoma\n\nHistory and Physical:\n\nPatient:\n\nIve  been  experiencing  generalized  itching,  abdominal  pain,  jaundice,  anorexia,  and  weight  loss.\n\nThese symptoms have been quite troubling.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI see. How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?\n\nPatient:\n\nThey've been ongoing for some time now. I also have a medical history of diabetes, which Ive been\n\ndealing with for 10 years. Im on insulin and glucophage, but my diabetes is poorly controlled.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI understand. Any other significant medical history?\n\nPatient:\n\nYes,  I  had  breast  cancer  in  the  past.  I  underwent  a  total  mastectomy  on  the  left  side,  followed  by\n\nchemotherapy  6 cycles, about 5 years ago.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThank you for sharing that. Lets take a look at your recent lab results.\n\nDoctor:\n\n\fYour lab results from June 16th, 2024, show:\n\nHBsAg: Negative\n\nAnti-HCV: Negative\n\nOn June 27th, an ultrasound of your abdomen showed a 6x5 cm mass in the left hepatic lobe.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhat does that mean for me?\n\nDoctor:\n\nIt means we need to investigate further. There are possibilities like intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma\n\nor metastatic malignancy. Based on these findings, we need to explore this with more imaging and\n\nlab tests.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYour blood work from June 25th shows the following:\n\nSodium (Na): 140\n\nPotassium (K): 4.3\n\nHemoglobin (Hb): 10.2\n\nTLC: 8.2\n\n\fMCV: 85\n\nPlatelets (PLT): 197\n\nTotal Bilirubin (T. Bili): 6.4\n\nALT: 236\n\nAST: 244\n\nALP: 963\n\nCreatinine (Cret): 0.4\n\nThese are important markers, particularly the liver enzymes which are elevated.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhat does all this mean?\n\nDoctor:\n\nIt  suggests  liver  involvement.  The  elevated  liver  enzymes  could  be  a  sign  of  liver  dysfunction.  We\n\nwill follow up with imaging and additional tests to narrow down the diagnosis.\n\nDoctor:\n\nHeres the plan moving forward:\n\nWe will get a CT scan with triphasic contrast using the HCC protocol.\n\n\fFresh  blood  work  will  be  done,  including  CA  19-9,  CA  125,  AFP,  and  PIVKA-II,  to  aid  in  further\n\ndiagnosis.\n\nContinue your medical management.\n\nWe'll follow up in 2 weeks for lab review and decide on further interventions such as ERCP or a liver\n\nbiopsy, if needed.\n\nPatient:\n\nI understand. What happens if the cancer is confirmed?\n\nDoctor:\n\nIf confirmed, we will determine whether the malignancy is localized or if it has spread, and we will\n\ndiscuss treatment options accordingly.\n\nFollow-Up: 22/7/2024\n\nDoctor:\n\nLets review your progress. Youve been experiencing loose stools after meals and some itching, but\n\notherwise, there are no active issues. How have you been feeling overall?\n\nPatient:\n\nThe itching has improved, but Im still experiencing loose stools.\n\nDoctor:\n\nWe will manage that. Regarding your condition, your CT scan from July 12th shows a lesion in the\n\nleft hepatic lobe thats likely intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, but given the elevated PIVKA-II levels,\n\n\fwe  might  be  dealing  with  a  mixed  hepatocholangiocarcinoma.  There  are  also  metastatic  lymph\n\nnodes above and below the diaphragm, plus a couple of small peritoneal nodules.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhat are the next steps?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWell perform an ERCP with stenting and brushing to get a better look and collect tissue for analysis.\n\nWell then review your case with the oncology team for further management.\n\nPatient:\n\nIs this something that can be treated?\n\nDoctor:\n\nIt  depends  on  how  we  proceed  with  treatment  after  the  ERCP.  The  oncologists  will  guide  us  on\n\nwhether chemotherapy is needed and what options are available.\n\nFollow-Up: 4/9/2024\n\nDoctor:\n\nHow are you feeling now?\n\nPatient:\n\nI feel better overall, but the itching is still there. I had the ERCP done on August 22nd, and it seems\n\nto have helped.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYes, the ERCP you underwent showed a large ulcer at the D1/D2 junction. The procedure included\n\n\fbiliary  sphincterotomy  and  stent  placement,  which  has  helped  with  the  biliary  drainage.  Your  lab\n\nresults from September 2nd show:\n\nTotal Bilirubin (T. Bili): 2.5\n\nDirect Bilirubin (D. Bili): 2.5\n\nALT: 53\n\nAST: 62\n\nALP: 224\n\nCreatinine: 0.5\n\nSodium (Na): 134\n\nPotassium (K): 5.1\n\nPatient:\n\nWhat do these results mean?\n\nDoctor:\n\nYour  bilirubin  levels  are  still  elevated,  but  theyve  improved  since  the  procedure.  The  liver  function\n\ntests are also showing signs of improvement. This is a positive sign.\n\nDoctor:\n\n\fThe CBD brushing from August 22nd showed that the cells collected were positive for malignancy.\n\nThe  pancreaticobiliary  cytology  report  suggests  the  possibility  of  metastatic  cancer  from  your\n\nprevious breast cancer, given the positive markers for GATA 3 and estrogen receptors.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWe  will  refer  you  to  INMOL  Hospital  for  an  oncology  consultation.  They  will  guide  us  on  whether\n\nchemotherapy  is  needed  based  on  the  findings  from  your  CT  scan  and  brushings.  Weve  also\n\ndiscussed these results with you and your family.\n\nPlan:\n\nReferral to primary oncologist at INMOL Hospital for further treatment.\n\nChemotherapy options will be explored with the oncology team.\n\nDoctor:\n\nWell keep monitoring your progress closely and adjust the treatment as needed.\n\n\f",

How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient:\n\nGood morning, doctor. I'm feeling okay, but Ive had some nausea and vomiting for the past month,\n\nand my back has been hurting a bit.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI see. Let's start by looking at your general health status. How is your weight?\n\nPatient:\n\nI weigh around 20kg now.\n\nDoctor:\n\nAlright, let's go over some of your previous medical history. Youve been diagnosed with Budd-Chiari\n\nSyndrome. Could you remind me about when you were first diagnosed and how things have been\n\nsince?\n\nPatient:\n\nI was diagnosed back in November 2017. I had abdominal distention and loose stools, so I went to\n\nServices Hospital where they did several tests. They diagnosed me with venous-occlusive disease,\n\nand  I  was  referred  to  CHL  for  Budd-Chiari  Syndrome.  I  also  had  an  ascitic  tap  done  there  and\n\n\fneeded a blood transfusion. Since then, Ive been on follow-up at CHL. Theyve done three EGDs,\n\nand I havent had any issues like jaundice, hematemesis, melena, or encephalopathy.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThank  you  for  updating  me.  Let's  go  over  your  current  medications.  You're  on  Aldactone,  Inderal,\n\nOra AD drops, and K Lot injections, correct?\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, that's right.\n\nDoctor:\n\nGood. Well make sure to keep track of how your body is responding to these treatments. Now, let's\n\nlook at your recent lab results.\n\nHere are the results from 06.06.23:\n\nBilirubin: 1.96\n\nALT: 28\n\nAST: 27\n\nALP: 230\n\nGGT: 62\n\nAlbumin: 4.29\n\n\fUrea: 17\n\nCreatinine: 0.38\n\nSodium (Na): 131\n\nPotassium (K): 4.9\n\nChloride (Cl): 96.1\n\nWBC: 6.8\n\nHemoglobin (Hb): 10\n\nPlatelets (PLT): 392\n\nINR: 1.6\n\nProtein C: 34 (low)\n\nAnti-HEV IgG: Negative\n\nAnti-HEV IgM: Negative\n\nAnti-HAV IgM: Negative\n\n\fHBsAg: Non-reactive\n\nAnti-HCV: Borderline (1.26)\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, those results are from my recent tests. Is there anything unusual about them?\n\nDoctor:\n\nThe  low  Protein  C  level  is  concerning  and  something  we  need  to  monitor.  Also,  your  INR  is  a  bit\n\nelevated, so we should keep an eye on that. Your liver function tests like ALT, AST, and albumin are\n\nshowing stable results, which is good.\n\nPatient:\n\nOkay, that sounds good to hear.\n\nDoctor:\n\nLets  also  discuss  your  latest  imaging  results.  Your  CT  scan  from  09.06.23  showed  changes\n\nconsistent with chronic liver disease and mild pelvic ascites. It also mentioned the non-visualization\n\nof the hepatic veins, which is typical for Budd-Chiari Syndrome.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes,  I  remember  that  from  the  report.  They  said  the  hepatic  veins  werent  visible,  and  it  showed\n\nsome changes in the liver.\n\nDoctor:\n\nCorrect.  The  EGD  you  had  on  13.06.23  showed  grade  III  esophageal  varices  with  red  signs,  and\n\nthey  placed  two  bands  for  treatment.  Youve  had  these  varices  for  some  time,  and  well  need  to\n\n\fcontinue monitoring them closely.\n\nPatient:\n\nHow often will I need to have these monitored?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWell  need  to  do  regular  surveillance  EGDs.  The  next  one  is  scheduled  for  tomorrow,  and  well\n\nreassess  after  that.  In  the  meantime,  weve  started  you  on  Furosemide  to  help  with  fluid  retention\n\nand manage your ascites. Well also check your vitamin D levels and repeat some labs.\n\nPatient:\n\nAlright, thank you for the plan, doctor. I also wanted to ask about the vaccinations. Do I need any\n\nvaccines?\n\nDoctor:\n\nYes, well be administering the Hepatitis A vaccine soon. Its important to make sure youre protected\n\nagainst that.\n\nPatient:\n\nGot it, doctor. Whats next in terms of the treatment plan?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWell continue with your current medications and focus on managing your symptoms. We may need\n\nto discuss your case further in a multidisciplinary team meeting once the ascites resolves. Well also\n\nbe following up on your lab results closely.\n\nPatient:\n\n\fThank you for the care and attention, doctor. I feel reassured.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYou're welcome, Mateen. Well take it one step at a time. See you tomorrow for your EGD, and well\n\ngo from there.\n\nDoctor:\n\nGood morning, Mateen. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient:\n\nGood morning, doctor.

How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient:  Ive  been  experiencing  some  episodes  of  melena  and  hematemesis  again,  between  12th\n\nand 13th of October. Ive also been feeling generally weak and sometimes I get fever off and on.\n\nDoctor:  I  see.  Can  you  tell  me  a  little  more  about  what  happened  before  these  recent  episodes?\n\nWhen did you last have these symptoms?\n\nPatient: I was in my usual health six months ago, but back in July, I had about 5-6 episodes of upper\n\nGI  bleeding,  with  hematemesis  and  melena.  My  hemoglobin  dropped,  and  I  had  to  get  two  blood\n\ntransfusions.  Since  then,  I  havent  experienced  any  more  bleeding  episodes  until  the  ones  this\n\nmonth.\n\nDoctor:  Understood.  Well  look  at  your  recent  lab  results  and  past  medical  history  to  get  a  better\n\npicture. Are you currently on any medications?\n\nPatient: Yes, Im on Carvedilol 3.125 mg twice a day, Spironolactone 100 mg once daily, Lactulose\n\nsyrup 30 ml once daily, Furosemide 40 mg once daily, and Albumin 100 ml IV once a week.\n\nDoctor:  Thanks  for  sharing  that.  Lets  go  over  the  results  of  your  investigations.  Your  latest\n\nendoscopy  from  October  1st  shows  esophageal  varices  with  red  signs,  and  band  ligation  was\n\nperformed  with  six  bands  applied.  Your  recent  ultrasound  from  October  21st  showed  coarse  liver\n\n\ftexture, splenomegaly, and moderate ascites. Additionally, your CT scan and MRI from earlier this\n\nyear also showed cirrhotic liver with splenomegaly and ascites. How have you been managing your\n\nsymptoms?\n\nPatient:  Ive  been  dealing  with  occasional  abdominal  distension,  and  Ive  had  some  issues  with\n\nconstipation as well. Other than that, I havent had any significant weight loss or fevers.\n\nDoctor: It seems like your liver condition has remained stable, but we need to continue monitoring\n\nthings  closely.  Based  on  your  recent  labs,  your  liver  function  is  stable,  though  there  are  signs  of\n\ndecompensation,  as  indicated  by  your  ascites  and  portal  hypertension.  For  now,  we  dont  need  to\n\nconsider  a  liver  transplant  immediately,  but  we  will  continue  with  medical  management  and\n\nsurveillance.\n\nPatient: Is there a need for a transplant now, or should I wait?\n\nDoctor:  At  this  stage,  liver  transplant  surgery  is  not  urgently  required.  Your  liver  function  is  still\n\ncompensated, but its important to keep an eye on any changes. We will do regular follow-up exams,\n\nincluding repeat ultrasound, AFP tests, and blood work in three months. If you notice any worsening\n\nof symptoms before then, dont hesitate to come in for a visit.\n\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. Ill make sure to follow the plan and return for my follow-up.\n\nDoctor:  You're  welcome.  Ill  also  keep  you  informed  about  the  potential  for  a  liver  transplant  if  the\n\ncondition progresses, but for now, let's focus on surveillance and managing the current symptoms.\n\nWell continue to work on your medications and follow-up tests.\n\n\f",

It was really bad.\n\nDoctor:  Since  that  episode,  we  also  noted  that  you  underwent  an  EGD  which  showed  Grade  IV\n\nesophageal  varices,  and  you  were  treated  with  banding.  Have  you  had  any  new  episodes  of\n\nvomiting blood or passing black stools since your last visit?\n\nPatient: I had another episode in August, but it wasnt as bad as the first time. I also had melena in\n\nSeptember.\n\nDoctor: Understood. Weve been monitoring your liver closely, and I can see that your MRCP from\n\nearlier this year showed changes consistent with congenital hepatic fibrosis and some intrahepatic\n\nbiliary  dilation.  Your  liver  biopsy  also  confirmed  ductal  plate  malformation,  which  aligns  with  that\n\ndiagnosis. How have you been feeling overall?\n\n\fPatient: I feel okay, just a little tired sometimes.\n\nDoctor:  It's  good  to  hear  that  you're  feeling  alright.  Your  labs  from  the  last  visit  showed  a  slight\n\nimprovement in your hemoglobin levels, but youre still a bit anemic, and your liver function tests are\n\nalso worth noting. I see your albumin is a bit lower than last time.\n\nPatient: Is that something I need to worry about, doctor?\n\nDoctor: It's something we will continue to monitor. Your liver is still not cirrhotic, which is good, but\n\nwe  do  need  to  keep  an  eye  on  the  biliary  channels  and  any  possible  complications  like  varices.\n\nHave you been taking the medications we prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes, Ive been taking the Inderal, Urso, and Sangobion as you instructed.\n\nDoctor: Good. We will continue the Inderal to manage any risk of variceal bleeding. Im also planning\n\nanother  endoscopy  to  check  the  varices  and  will  schedule  a  follow-up  CT  to  keep  track  of  any\n\nchanges. Have you been following up with any labs recently?\n\nPatient:  Yes,  I  did  some  labs  a  few  weeks  ago,  and  the  results  were  similar  to  before.  My\n\nhemoglobin is still on the lower side, but the liver function tests havent changed much.\n\nDoctor: Alright, Ill order a few more tests today, including viral serology and blood grouping, as well\n\nas some baseline labs. We also need to prepare for a potential procedure tomorrow.\n\nPatient: What procedure is that, doctor?\n\n\fDoctor: We are scheduling another endoscopy to evaluate your varices and check for any changes.\n\nWe will also need anesthesia, so please fast after 2 AM tonight and make sure you're well-hydrated\n\nfor the procedure.\n\nPatient: Okay, Ill follow the instructions.\n\nDoctor:  Perfect.  After  this  procedure,  well  decide  if  any  additional  treatment  is  needed,  including\n\nconsidering the possibility of shunting if the varices are a significant concern. However, I understand\n\nthat your family may not be ready for surgery yet.\n\nPatient: Yes, my father is not comfortable with the idea of surgery right now.\n\nDoctor:  Understood.  Well  keep  it  under  medical  management  for  now,  and  continue  monitoring\n\nclosely. Ill have my team prepare for the procedure and get all necessary labs done today.\n\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.\n\nDoctor:  Youre  welcome,  Khadija.  We'll  take  good  care  of  you.  Let's  get  everything  ready  for\n\ntomorrow,  and  well  talk  again  after  the  procedure.  If  you  feel  unwell  or  have  any  new  symptoms\n\nbefore then, don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nMedical Notes:\n\nDiagnosis: Congenital Hepatic Fibrosis, Esophageal Varices\n\nMedications:\n\n\fInderal 10mg, TDS\n\nUrso 250mg, BD\n\nSangobion, BD\n\nLabs:\n\nT.Bil: 0.7 mg/dL\n\nD.Bil: 0.2 mg/dL\n\nALT/AST: 45/66 U/L\n\nALP: 220 U/L\n\nAlbumin: 4.3 g/dL\n\nHemoglobin: 10.2 g/dL\n\nPlatelets: 110\n\nINR: 1.08\n\nPlan:\n\nPrepare for EGD tomorrow.\n\n\fObtain baseline labs, including viral serology.\n\nFast after 2 AM.\n\nAdminister fluids at 40 ml/hr after NPO.\n\nMonitor for signs of bleeding; continue with Inderal.\n\nContinue monitoring liver function closely.\n\nFollow-up after procedure.\n\n\f",

Can  you  tell  me  how  you've  been  feeling\n\nsince your last visit?\"\n\nPatient: \"Ive been doing okay, but recently I had some episodes of hematemesis and melena. This\n\nhappened  between  October  12th  and  13th,  and  I've  also  been  feeling  generally  weak.  Ive  had  a\n\nfever here and there, but nothing constant.\"\n\nDoctor: \"I see. So, how long have you been experiencing these episodes?\"\n\nPatient: \"I didnt have any bleeding episodes between July and October, but after the recent ones,\n\nIve been feeling worse. I also have some abdominal distension and constipation.\"\n\nDoctor:  \"Thank  you  for  sharing  that.  Let's  go  over  your  previous  health  history.  You  mentioned\n\nhaving episodes of upper GI bleeding a few months ago, correct?\"\n\nPatient:  \"Yes,  around  3  months  back,  I  had  5-6  episodes  of  hematemesis  and  melena.  My\n\nhemoglobin dropped after that, and I had to get two units of blood transfused.\"\n\nDoctor:  \"I  see.  You  mentioned  that  your  investigations  showed  liver  cirrhosis,  and  you've  had\n\nseveral endoscopies done. Have any treatments been administered for the bleeding?\"\n\nPatient:  \"Yes,  Ive  had  endoscopies  done,  and  the  last  one  was  on  October  1st.  They  did  band\n\n\fligation on my esophageal varices.\"\n\nDoctor: \"Good. Now, I also see that your viral markers came back negative. No signs of hepatitis,\n\nright?\"\n\nPatient: \"Yes, thats correct. I dont have any history of hepatitis.\"\n\nDoctor:  \"Alright.  Let's  talk  about  your  current  medications.  You  are  on  carvedilol,  spironolactone,\n\nlactulose, furosemide, and albumin, is that correct?\"\n\nPatient: \"Yes, thats right. I take Carvedilol twice a day, Spironolactone once a day, Lactulose syrup\n\nonce a day, Furosemide daily, and Albumin once a week through an IV.\"\n\nDoctor:  \"Thanks  for  confirming.  Now,  lets  go  over  your  investigations.  Your  ultrasound  from  April\n\nshowed  a  heterogeneous  liver  parenchyma  with  portal  vein  thrombus,  splenomegaly,  and  ascites.\n\nYour MRI in June revealed a cirrhotic liver with a mass in segment VIII, and the CT scan confirmed\n\ncirrhosis with splenomegaly and ascites. Your most recent ultrasound shows more irregularities with\n\nyour liver, splenomegaly, and ascites, is that correct?\"\n\nPatient: \"Yes, the ultrasound on October 21st confirmed that, along with the splenomegaly.\"\n\nDoctor:  \"Based  on  these  findings,  you  have  decompensated  chronic  liver  disease  with  features  of\n\nBudd-Chiari syndrome. Your liver is cirrhotic, and there are multiple complications associated with it,\n\nincluding  the  portal  hypertension  and  ascites.  We  also  reviewed  your  lab  results.  I  can  see  your\n\nhemoglobin is now stable, but your bilirubin levels remain elevated, along with your ALT/AST levels,\n\nwhich suggest ongoing liver dysfunction.\"\n\n\fPatient: \"Yes, I noticed that my hemoglobin was better recently, but the bilirubin is still high. What\n\ndoes that mean for my treatment?\"\n\nDoctor: \"The good news is that your liver function is stable for now, but its still quite compromised.\n\nThe  next  step  for  you  is  to  consider  a  liver  transplant,  which  would  be  the  definitive  treatment.\n\nHowever,  if  youre  not  ready  for  that  yet,  we  can  consider  a  procedure  called  TIPS  (Transjugular\n\nIntrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt) as a bridge. This can help manage your portal hypertension.\"\n\nPatient: \"What is the TIPS procedure exactly?\"\n\nDoctor: \"TIPS is a procedure where we create a channel in the liver to relieve the pressure in the\n\nportal  vein.  This  helps  with  the  ascites  and  varices  bleeding.  However,  its  a  temporary  solution.  A\n\nliver transplant is the long-term solution, but it requires finding a suitable donor.\"\n\nPatient: \"What do I need to do for the liver transplant?\"\n\nDoctor: \"The first step is to meet with a transplant coordinator, who will assess both your condition\n\nand find a suitable donor. The donor will need to meet certain criteria, and well go over the financial\n\naspects of the procedure as well.\"\n\nPatient: \"I understand. What should I do now?\"\n\nDoctor: \"For now, continue your medications as prescribed. Youll need regular monitoring with lab\n\nwork  and  imaging.  We'll  repeat  your  ultrasound  and  AFP  levels  in  three  months,  and  you  should\n\nfollow up with us before that if you experience any emergencies.\"\n\nPatient:  \"Okay,  thank  you.  Ill  follow  up  with  the  transplant  coordinator  and  keep  an  eye  on  my\n\n\fsymptoms.\"\n\nDoctor: \"Youre welcome. Take care of yourself, and let us know if anything changes.

Lets  take  a  look  at  the  results  from  your  initial  visit  on  6th  October  2022.  Your  lab\n\nresults  show  elevated  ALT  and  AST  levels,  with  ALT  at  485  and  AST  at  195.  Your  bilirubin  is\n\nelevated at 2.4, with a direct bilirubin of 1.5. Also, your liver function markers are a bit off, with an\n\nALP of 801 and GGT at 54.\n\nPatient: Yes, the doctor mentioned that the liver is impacted. I also see that my hemoglobin was low\n\nat 7.7, and my white blood cell count was high at 14.1. What does all this mean?\n\nDoctor: Your hemoglobin is low, which could explain the pallor youre experiencing. The high white\n\nblood cell count suggests some infection or inflammation. We also see some coagulation issues with\n\nan INR of 1.3, which is a bit elevated. Your albumin is also low at 2.9, which could be a sign of liver\n\ndysfunction.\n\nPatient: Oh, I see. What did the imaging show?\n\nDoctor: The ultrasound from September showed signs of veno-occlusive syndrome. Your CT scan\n\nfrom  1st  October  2022  showed  hepatomegaly  with  heterogeneous  density,  hypertrophy  of  the\n\ncaudate  lobe,  and  non-visualization  of  the  hepatic  veins,  which  strongly  suggests  Budd-Chiari\n\nsyndrome.\n\n\fPatient: And what are the next steps for me?\n\nDoctor: For now, I recommend continuing your current medications, including Aldactone, Lasoride,\n\nand Ibert. We also need to check for any further liver damage and submit a CD of your CT scan for\n\nfurther review. Lets schedule a virtual clinic tomorrow for follow-up.\n\nPatient: Its been a while since my last visit. Im back for a follow-up. I still have abdominal distension,\n\nand Im still on the same medications. My weight is 15.2 kg, and Im from Sahiwal.\n\nDoctor: Its good to see you again. Your abdominal distension has been ongoing for 2 months, and it\n\nseems that your condition is still being managed with Aldactone and Ibert. On examination, theres\n\nno  jaundice  or  pallor,  but  your  abdomen  remains  soft  and  non-tender  with  a  liver  palpable  3  cm\n\nbelow the costal margin.\n\nPatient: Ive heard of Budd-Chiari syndrome. Is that still the diagnosis?\n\nDoctor:  Yes,  based  on  your  imaging  findings,  the  diagnosis  remains  Budd-Chiari  syndrome.  Well\n\nneed to monitor your liver function closely. Ive ordered some more tests, including a full CBC, liver\n\nfunction tests, and coagulation profiles like protein C and anti-thrombin III. Additionally, well check\n\nfor any infections or viral activity with tests for HAV and HEV.\n\nPatient: Okay, what else is planned?\n\nDoctor: Ive prescribed Vitamin K injections weekly, along with Maltofer for iron supplementation and\n\nVermox  for  any  possible  parasitic  infections.  Ill  also  start  you  on  Spiromide  to  help  manage  fluid\n\nretention. Well discuss the findings after your CT scan CD submission. Lets see you again in one\n\n\fmonth.\n\nPatient: I'm back for my follow-up. Ive been experiencing abdominal distension for 2 months again.\n\nMy current weight is 15.2 kg.\n\nDoctor: Thank you for coming in. Your blood tests from December 2022 show that your bilirubin is\n\nnow  1.5,  ALT  is  27,  and  AST  is  57.  Your  liver  function  is  relatively  stable,  but  we  still  need  to  be\n\ncautious since youve had multiple episodes of abdominal distension.\n\nPatient: What else do we need to address?\n\nDoctor:  In  addition  to  your  liver  markers,  your  coagulation  profile  shows  that  your  INR  is  slightly\n\nelevated  at  1.8,  and  protein  C  levels  are  lower  than  normal.  Its  important  we  manage  this  with\n\nVitamin  K  supplementation  and  other  treatments.  Ive  added  Inderal  to  help  control  any  blood\n\npressure concerns. We still need to check for liver biopsy and possibly an endoscopy to get a better\n\nlook at any varices.\n\nPatient: Sounds like theres still a lot to do.\n\nDoctor: Yes, but youre responding well to treatment. Lets continue with the current medications and\n\nprepare for the next steps. Well schedule another follow-up after the liver biopsy and EGD, and well\n\nmonitor your condition closely.\n\nPatient: Its been almost a year now. Im back for my follow-up. Im currently 4 years old and weigh 18\n\nkg.  My  abdominal  distension  is  worse,  and  Im  also  dealing  with  ascites,  jaundice,  and  a  few\n\nepisodes of vomiting blood.\n\n\fDoctor: I see that youve had a tough time recently. Youve been experiencing jaundice and severe\n\nascites. Your physical examination shows generalized edema, pallor, and hyperemic mucosa. The\n\nliver is enlarged, and your spleen is not palpable.\n\nPatient: Is it still Budd-Chiari syndrome?\n\nDoctor: Yes, your CT scan from 1st October 2022 and ultrasound from April 2024 confirm that the\n\nliver damage is consistent with Budd-Chiari syndrome. Youve had several complications with blood\n\nclots  and  varices,  as  seen  in  your  endoscopy  in  September  2024,  where  we  applied  3  bands  to\n\ncontrol the varices.\n\nPatient: How can we treat this now?\n\nDoctor:  You  need  to  be  on  continuous  management,  including  Spironolactone  for  fluid  retention,\n\nLasoride  for  your  ascites,  and  Vitamin  K  injections.  Weve  started  you  on  Propanolol  to  help  with\n\nblood  pressure  and  prevent  bleeding.  We  also  need  to  ensure  you  receive  ongoing  care  at  a\n\nchildrens  hospital  where  they  can  optimize  your  medical  treatment.  Given  the  severity,  a  liver\n\ntransplant is still the most definitive treatment, but we need to review your financial situation before\n\nproceeding.\n\nPatient: What should I do now?\n\nDoctor:  Continue  with  the  current  medications  and  refer  to  the  childrens  hospital  for  the  required\n\ntreatment  optimization.  After  the  financial  screening,  we  can  discuss  further  plans,  including\n\npotential liver transplant options.\n\nPatient: Thank you for the care, Doctor. Ill follow your instructions.\n\n\fDoctor: You're welcome. Well continue monitoring you closely and take the necessary steps for your\n\ncare.\n\n\f",

The  abdominal  distention  hasnt  improved,\n\nand  hes  still  been  very  sleepy  and  irritable.  He  also  has  loose  stools  after  every  meal,  and  Ive\n\nnoticed black, tarry stools quite frequently.\n\nDoctor: I see. How is his cough? Has it gotten any better?\n\nPatient's Mother: His cough is dry and mild, and it's been going on for about 15 days now. It doesn't\n\nseem to be getting worse, though.\n\nDoctor: Any other new symptoms, or is it just the same as before?\n\nPatient's Mother: Theres no new bleeding or vomiting, but he has been extremely drowsy and not\n\nvery responsive. He isnt even responding to pain, which is worrying. His abdomen is still distended,\n\nand when I checked, I could feel a fluid thrill.\n\nDoctor: How's his appetite and behavior? Has he been eating normally?\n\nPatient's Mother: His appetite is not great, and he is just sleeping a lot. Hes very irritable when hes\n\nawake and doesnt seem to be his usual self.\n\n\fDoctor: Lets go over some of the key investigations and examinations weve done. On his ultrasound\n\non  March  17th,  2024,  it  showed  mild  hepatomegaly,  but  the  texture  was  homogeneous.  His  lab\n\nresults  from  May  2024  showed  a  few  important  things:  his  hemoglobin  was  14,  and  his  platelets\n\nwere  at  191.  His  liver  function  tests  showed  elevated  GGT  (227)  and  a  slightly  low  albumin  level\n\n(2.9). His INR is 1.53, which suggests some risk with clotting.\n\nPatient's  Mother:  Yes,  I  remember  those  numbers.  The  doctor  had  mentioned  his  liver  being\n\naffected and had done some testing, but Im still unclear on what exactly this means for him.\n\nDoctor:  Jawad  is  suspected  to  have  congenital  hepatic  fibrosis,  which  has  led  to  some\n\ndecompensation,  particularly  hepatic  encephalopathy,  ascites,  and  varices.  Weve  seen  him\n\npreviously for endoscopies. The last one was on May 21, 2024, and showed grade 1 varices with no\n\ngastroenteropathy.\n\nPatient's Mother: He had some banding done earlier, right? Did that help at all?\n\nDoctor: Yes, there were bands applied during his previous endoscopies, including one in July 2023.\n\nBut as you can see, we are still monitoring him closely for varices and any changes in his condition.\n\nPatient's Mother: He seems much sleepier now. Is that because of his liver condition?\n\nDoctor:  Yes,  the  drowsiness  and  lack  of  responsiveness  youre  seeing  can  be  linked  to  hepatic\n\nencephalopathy. His liver is struggling to process toxins, which may be affecting his brain function.\n\nDoctor: I see that youre following the medication regimen. He is currently on:\n\nInderal 10mg twice a day for his blood pressure and varices.\n\n\fA D E Drops, 5 drops daily for his vitamin A, D, and E.\n\nMCT Oil, 5ml twice a day for nutritional support.\n\nSpironolactone, 6.25mg three times a day, for ascites.\n\nVitamin K injections, twice a week, to help with clotting.\n\nPatient's  Mother:  Yes,  hes  been  on  these  medications.  Is  there  anything  else  that  needs  to  be\n\nchanged or added?\n\nDoctor: Were going to continue with this regimen for now. The plan includes medical optimization,\n\nespecially  for  the  hepatic  encephalopathy  and  ascites.  I  will  also  refer  you  to  Childrens  Hospital\n\nLahore for further management, as they can provide additional support for his liver condition. Well\n\nalso need to arrange blood donors for a potential liver transplant, so please keep that in mind.\n\nPatient's Mother: That sounds serious. I know his blood group is AB+, so Ill make sure to arrange\n\ntwo donors as instructed.\n\nDoctor:  Yes,  thats  crucial.  Well  continue  to  monitor  his  liver  function  and  perform  more  tests,\n\nincluding  a  liver  biopsy  and  imaging  to  better  assess  his  condition.  I  also  recommend  we  monitor\n\nammonia levels and consider starting anti-ammonia treatments.\n\nPatient's Mother: Should I be worried about his condition worsening?\n\nDoctor: Its important to be cautious, but we are taking the necessary steps to stabilize his condition.\n\n\fHowever, the liver is quite a delicate organ, and we need to keep a close eye on him. Well continue\n\nto monitor his varices and hepatic function closely.\n\nPatient's  Mother:  Thank  you  for  explaining  everything.  Ill  make  sure  to  follow  the  instructions  and\n\narrange for the blood donors.\n\nDoctor: Youre welcome. Well take it step by step, and Ill see you back in a few months for follow-up.\n\nMake sure you continue with the prescribed medications, and let me know if theres any change in\n\nhis condition.\n\nFollow-up Plan:\n\nContinue current medications as prescribed.\n\nLiver biopsy and shearwave elastography to assess liver stiffness.\n\nAnti-ammonia treatment and monitoring of ammonia levels.\n\nBlood donors arranged for potential liver transplant.\n\nFollow-up at Childrens Hospital Lahore for medical optimization and transplant counseling.\n\nFollow-up after 3 months at PKLI.\n\n\f",

How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient:\n\nIm  doing  okay,  but  Ive  been  following  up  for  my  condition,  Budd  Chiari  syndrome.  I  wanted  to\n\nupdate you on my progress.\n\nDoctor:\n\nOf course, lets go over your history first. You were diagnosed with Budd Chiari syndrome and youve\n\nhad a history of abdominal distension. This began about three years ago when you were admitted to\n\nthe Children's Hospital. You were treated by Dr. Nadeem Anjum.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, I remember. It was pretty serious back then. I also have a family history of this condition. I am\n\nthe second in order of four siblings.\n\nDoctor:\n\nGot  it.  Lets  check  your  lab  results.  The  MRI  you  had  in  2019  showed  hepatosplenomegaly  with\n\nhypertrophy  of  the  caudate  lobe  and  narrowed  hepatic  veins,  which  pointed  to  venous  occlusive\n\n\fdisease. Your serum ceruloplasmin was elevated at 0.57. The OGD in October 2019 did not show\n\nany esophageal varices.\n\nPatient:\n\nI see. Ive been keeping track of my medications. They include:\n\nRiseK Insta sachet\n\nVida Z tablet (one per day)\n\nSpiromide 20mg (on alternate days)\n\nVadil (Carvedilol) 3.125 mg, twice a day\n\nRivaroxaban 10mg, once a day\n\nDoctor:\n\nGood, its important to stick with that regimen. Lets review the more recent lab results from May 9,\n\n2022:\n\nSodium: 134\n\nPotassium: 3.8\n\nTotal Bilirubin: 0.6\n\nDirect Bilirubin: 0.2\n\n\fIndirect Bilirubin: 0.2\n\nALT: 20\n\nAST: 36\n\nALP: 210\n\nAlbumin: 4.1\n\nHBsAg: Negative\n\nAnti-HCV: Negative\n\nCreatinine: 0.7\n\nYour CBC was:\n\nTLC: 9.9\n\nHemoglobin: 12\n\nPlatelets: 320\n\nINR: 1.0\n\n\fPatient:\n\nThank  you,  Doctor.  I  also  had  an  ultrasound  on  May  9,  2022,  which  showed  hepatomegaly  with\n\ncoarse hepatic echotexture. The hepatic veins were narrowed, but flow was present, and my spleen\n\nwas slightly enlarged at 10.9 cm. The CT scan on June 14, 2022, showed lobulated liver contours,\n\nand the hepatic veins werent visible, which is typical for my condition. I also had enlarged spleen at\n\n13.5 cm and varices in the anterior abdominal wall and pelvis.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYes, those findings match your diagnosis. I also reviewed your CT triphasic scan from July 22, 2022.\n\nThe  scan  showed  signs  of  Budd  Chiari  syndrome  with  an  enlarged,  congested  liver  and\n\nnon-opacified  hepatic  veins,  and  your  retrohepatic  IVC  was  narrowed.  No  signs  of  hepatocellular\n\ncarcinoma were found, which is good news.\n\nPatient:\n\nThats  reassuring.  On  my  physical  exam  today,  I  noticed  I  dont  have  jaundice,  but  there  is  some\n\npallor,  and  I  still  have  clubbing.  The  left  cervical  lymph  node  is  palpable.  Otherwise,  Im  alert  and\n\nactive.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThats good to hear. Your liver is palpable, with a 6 cm BCM, and your spleen is also palpable. There\n\nare  no  signs  of  ascites  right  now.  For  medications,  well  continue  your  current  regimen,  and  well\n\ndiscuss in the MDT meeting on Friday.\n\nPatient:\n\nGreat! Whats the next step in my treatment plan, Doctor?\n\nDoctor:\n\n\fWell need to monitor your liver condition closely. We plan to admit you on Monday and schedule an\n\nendoscopy on Tuesday. Additionally, well run some tests, including Protein C, S, and Antithrombin\n\nlevels, to further assess your condition.\n\nPatient:\n\nOkay, I understand. Thank you.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYou're welcome. Well also keep you informed about the next steps after your endoscopy. If needed,\n\nwell  continue  medical  management,  but  a  liver  transplant  may  be  required  if  your  liver\n\ndecompensates.\n\nPatient:\n\nUnderstood. Ill follow the plan. Ill be back for the next steps.\n\nDoctor:\n\nPerfect. Take care, and well see you on Monday.\n\nPatient:\n\nThank you, Doctor.\n\n\f",

Let's review your medical history. You have a history of Hepatitis C\n\nVirus (HCV), Cirrhosis (DCLD), and currently no Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). However, a CT\n\nscan revealed a GB mass with hepatic metastases. What brings you in today?\n\nPatient:\n\nI'm experiencing right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain and feeling very lethargic.\n\nDoctor:\n\nUnderstood. We will run a series of tests. Your recent lab results on 4/8/2024 show:\n\nPIVKA: 4461\n\nINR: 1.0\n\nAmylase: 245\n\nHemoglobin (Hb): 12.9, Platelets (PLT): 158\n\n\fLiver Function Test (LFT):\n\nTotal Bilirubin (t.billi): 5.0\n\nAlbumin (alb): 6.0\n\nCreatinine: 0.7\n\nDoctor's Plan:\n\nWe will submit a CT scan for further assessment and establish baseline data. A High-Resolution CT\n\n(HRCT)  scan  will  be  performed,  and  the  liver  biopsy  versus  ERCP  decision  will  be  made  after\n\ndiscussion in the MDT.\n\nDate: 20/09/2024\n\nDoctor (Dr. Osama Tariq Butt):\n\nWe  have  completed  the  MDT  (Multi-Disciplinary  Team)  review.  We've  discussed  your  case  and\n\nmade  some  decisions.  Your  official  follow-up  appointment  is  scheduled  for  20/11/2024,  but  weve\n\nadvised you to have a virtual clinic appointment for an early follow-up.\n\nDate: 20/11/2024\n\nDoctor (Dr. Osama Tariq Butt / Dr. Rimsha Saeed):\n\nYou are here for your follow-up. Lets summarize your case. You have a history of HCV, DCLD, and\n\nHCC.  Youve  experienced  weight  loss  and  currently  have  jaundice,  burning  micturition,  and  fever.\n\nWe see decompensation with jaundice and HCC. Your examination shows youre weak-looking, with\n\nan ECOG score of 0. The abdomen is soft and non-tender.\n\n\fDoctor:\n\nLets go over your recent lab results from 4/8/2024 and 20/11/2024:\n\n4/8/2024:\n\nPIVKA: 4461\n\nINR: 1.0\n\nAmylase: 245\n\nHemoglobin: 12.9  8.6\n\nPlatelets: 158  277\n\nWBC: 19.22\n\nTotal Bilirubin: 5.0  16\n\nAlbumin: 6.0  2.89\n\nALT/AST: 83/195\n\nALP: 334\n\nCreatinine: 0.7\n\n\fSodium: 130\n\nPotassium: 3.48\n\nDoctor's Assessment:\n\nYour condition seems to be HCV-related HCC with possible biliary invasion or cholangiocarcinoma.\n\nThe MDT review indicates three HCC lesions, two in the right lobe and one at the confluence. The\n\ntumor  at  the  hilum  is  uncertainit  might  be  cholangiocarcinoma  or  biliary  invasion  of  HCC.  We\n\nsuggest an ERCP to manage jaundice and a possible biopsy of the hilar lymph node.\n\nDoctor's Plan:\n\nUrsodeoxycholic acid 250mg twice daily\n\nMultivitamin\n\nCefspan\n\nSodium alginate (Gaviscon syrup)\n\nAll baseline tests for the Child-MELD score\n\nTriphasic CT scan\n\nFollow-up in two weeks to decide on liver biopsy\n\n\fDate: 2/12/2024\n\nDoctor (Dr. Atif):\n\nIn this visit, you continue to have jaundice, burning micturition, and fever. Lets review your current\n\ncondition. You have a history of HCV, DCLD, and HCC with weight loss. On examination, you are\n\nweak-looking, with an ECOG score of 0. Your abdomen remains soft and non-tender.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYour recent labs from 2/12/2024 show:\n\nTotal Bilirubin (BILI): 1.65\n\nALT: 68\n\nAST: 85\n\nALP: 660\n\nGGT: 1226\n\nCreatinine: 0.66\n\nPlatelets: 392\n\nDoctor's Plan:\n\nContinue Ursodeoxycholic acid, multivitamin, and other medications\n\n\fCT Triphasic HCC protocol\n\nFollow-up after 2 days to review progress\n\nDiscuss liver biopsy after CT results\n\nDate: 6/1/2025\n\nDoctor (Hepatology Clinic):\n\nYou have a history of treatment-experienced HCV and have achieved an SVR (Sustained Virologic\n\nResponse).  Currently,  you're  experiencing  jaundice.  You've  had  ERCP  and  EUS  procedures  with\n\nstenting.  Post-ERCP  biopsies  didnt  show  malignancy,  but  theres  ongoing  suspicion  for  HCC  or\n\ncholangiocarcinoma.\n\nDoctor's Plan:\n\nContinue Ursodeoxycholic acid, Distalgesic, and Gaviscon\n\nRepeat ERCP and follow-up in oncology for review\n\nFurther CT scans to assess liver lesions and guide biopsy decisions\n\n\f",

How are you feeling?\n\nPatient: Ive been feeling jaundiced for the past two months. Its been really bothering me.\n\nDoctor: I see. Can you tell me if you've had any issues like vomiting blood or experiencing ascites?\n\nPatient: No, no hematemesis or ascites. But I did have melena about two weeks ago.\n\nDoctor:  Thank  you  for  sharing  that.  Have  you  experienced  any  significant  weight  loss  or  required\n\nany blood transfusions?\n\nPatient: No, I havent lost significant weight, and I haven't had any transfusions.\n\nDoctor: What about fevers or night sweats? Any of those symptoms?\n\nPatient: No, I haven't had any fevers or night sweats.\n\nDoctor:  Okay,  lets  go  over  your  medical  history  now.  Have  you  had  any  prior  medical  or  surgical\n\nissues?\n\nPatient: No, I haven't had any significant medical or surgical history.\n\n\fDoctor: Are you on any medications currently?\n\nPatient: Yes, Im taking Nexium 40 mg once a day and Urso 500 mg twice a day.\n\nDoctor: I see. Are there any allergies or any other medications you have taken in the past that we\n\nshould know about?\n\nPatient: No allergies, and no other significant past medications.\n\nDoctor: Alright. Can you tell me a little about your social history? Any addictions or financial strains?\n\nPatient: No addictions, and no financial strains either.\n\nDoctor:  That's  good  to  hear.  How  about  your  family  medical  history?  Any  history  of  diabetes,\n\nhypertension, or cancer?\n\nPatient: No, my family history is unremarkable.\n\nDoctor: Alright, let's talk about any psychological issues. Do you feel depressed?\n\nPatient: No, I dont feel depressed.\n\nDoctor: Thats reassuring. Lets proceed with a physical examination. Can you describe any cognitive\n\nor physical limitations?\n\nPatient: No, I don't have any cognitive impairment or mobility issues.\n\n\fDoctor:  Excellent.  Let's  check  your  examination  results.  Your  neurological  exam  shows  youre\n\nconscious  and  well-oriented  with  a  GCS  of  15/15.  Your  cardiovascular  system  and  respiratory\n\nexams are normal. Your abdominal exam shows no tenderness or distension.\n\nDoctor: We have some imaging results as well. Your ultrasound shows a distal CBD obstruction and\n\nmild dilatation of biliary channels. Your CT scan from August 1st shows a cirrhotic liver with a 5 cm\n\nand 2 cm lesion in segments 7 and 8, with no ascites and upper abdominal lymphadenopathy.\n\nDoctor: Your lab results from early August indicate elevated bilirubin levels and liver enzymes. Your\n\nAFP is 8, and CEA is 1.5. Your lipase is significantly elevated at 3537, and your albumin is 3.3.\n\nDoctor:  Based  on  these  results,  we  have  a  possible  diagnosis  of  HCV/DCLD  with  a  potential  liver\n\nlesion  that  might  be  HCC.  Theres  also  obstructive  jaundice,  and  unfortunately,  the  ERCP  was\n\nunsuccessful. Im recommending further imaging and labs, including HRCT, CA-19-9 levels, and liver\n\nbiopsy to get a better diagnosis.\n\nPatient: Whats the next step, doctor?\n\nDoctor:  Well  schedule  an  HRCT  and  submit  the  necessary  CDs.  Well  also  follow  up  with  the\n\nCA-19-9 levels. Based on those results, well decide whether to proceed with ERCP again or go for a\n\nliver lesion biopsy. For now, Im prescribing Urso 250 mg three times a day, Cefsapan 400 mg once\n\na day, PPI 40 mg, a multivitamin, and Distelgesic.\n\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. Ill follow the plan.\n\nDoctor: I see you have a new concern. We have a possible case of osseous metastasis now. Your\n\nlatest  imaging  shows  mild  intrahepatic  biliary  dilatation  and  a  soft  tissue  mass  in  the  distal  CBD.\n\n\fThere  are  also  enlarged  necrotic/non-necrotic  metastatic  lymph  nodes  in  the  region,  along  with\n\narterially enhancing hepatic lesions.\n\nDoctor:  The  possibilities  include  a  distal  CBD  mass  with  regional  nodal,  mesenteric,  and  hepatic\n\nmetastasis. We also need to consider the option of HCC with nodal metastasis.\n\nDoctor: The next step is to proceed with ERCP, biopsy, and stenting. We should also correlate with\n\nyour  CA-19-9  levels.  Ive  discussed  your  prognosis,  and  unfortunately,  it  appears  poor,  but  well\n\ncontinue to monitor the situation closely.\n\nPatient: I understand, doctor. Thank you for the clarity.\n\nPlan:\n\nFollow-up Diagnostics:\n\nHRCT\n\nCD submission\n\nCA-19-9 levels\n\nLiver lesion biopsy vs. ERCP (decision after review)\n\nMedications:\n\nUrso 250 mg TDS\n\n\fCefsapan 400 mg OD\n\nPPI 40 mg\n\nMultivitamin\n\nDistelgesic\n\nFollow-up in 1 week\n\n\f",

Ive been coughing for the past three days,\n\nand its been bothering me quite a bit.\"\n\nDoctor: \"Alright, lets go over everything in detail. Youve mentioned a cough, but we need to check\n\non the other things as well. Could you tell me if youve had any other issues in the past month?\"\n\nPatient: \"Yes, actually. About a month ago, I had loose motions, vomiting, abdominal distension, and\n\nfever. I went through some investigations, and they suspected ascites.\"\n\nDoctor: \"Thank you for the details. Im reviewing your medical history. There's nothing significant in\n\nyour  past  medical  or  surgical  history,  and  your  family  history  doesnt  show  anything  remarkable\n\neither.  Your  birth  was  uneventful,  and  vaccinations  have  been  given  according  to  the  national\n\nschedule. Your development and nutrition seem to be normal, too.\"\n\nPatient: \"Yes, everything else has been fine up until now.\"\n\nDoctor: \"Alright, lets examine you. Ive noted that your weight and height are within the 5th centile for\n\nyour age, but your height is above the 50th centile. Theres no jaundice, no pallor, and no swelling.\n\nYour heart sounds normal. Your consciousness is intact, with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15/15. Your\n\nbreathing is also normal.\"\n\nPatient: \"Okay, thats a relief.\"\n\n\fDoctor:  \"Your  abdominal  examination  shows  a  soft  abdomen  with  a  6  cm  enlarged  liver,  but  the\n\nspleen is not palpable. Theres no sign of portal vein thrombosis. Lets review your lab results. Your\n\nbilirubin is 1.7, and liver enzymes are elevated: ALT is 369, AST is 336, ALP is 218, and GGT is 34.\n\nYour albumin is at 3.4, and your INR is 1.6, indicating some liver dysfunction. You also have a mild\n\ndecrease in your platelets (100), and sodium levels are a bit low at 128.\"\n\nPatient: \"What does all that mean, doctor?\"\n\nDoctor: \"The liver enzymes are quite high, which indicates liver stress or injury. The low sodium and\n\nplatelets  can  be  related  to  liver  problems.  I  also  see  that  you  have  a  negative  autoimmune  profile\n\nand negative hepatitis B and C results. This could be helpful in understanding the cause.\"\n\nPatient: \"What do the scans show?\"\n\nDoctor: \"Your ultrasound from August 8th showed hepatomegaly with altered liver echotexture and\n\nnarrowing of the hepatic veins. It is suggestive of Budd-Chiari syndrome, which is a blockage of the\n\nhepatic  veins.  Your  CT  scan  on  August  9th  confirmed  hepatomegaly  with  heterogeneous\n\nparenchymal  enhancement,  a  narrowed  intrahepatic  IVC,  and  mild  ascites,  splenomegaly,  and\n\nnecrotic mesenteric lymph nodes. These are concerning signs of liver disease.\"\n\nPatient: \"What are we doing about it?\"\n\nDoctor:  \"Weve  started  you  on  treatment  with  spironolactone  to  manage  ascites  and  vitamin  K\n\nsupplementation.  Were  also  planning  further  tests,  including  a  Fibroscan  today,  and  we'll  need  to\n\nrepeat  some  baseline  tests  like  Protein  C,  Anti-thrombin  III,  and  IgG.  You  should  follow  a  low-salt\n\ndiet and continue taking your medications, including omeprazole for stomach protection.\"\n\n\fFollow-Up Visit (27.08.2024)\n\nPatient: \"Doctor, I dont have any major complaints right now, but Ive been following the treatment.\"\n\nDoctor:  \"Thats  good  to  hear.  Lets  review  your  condition.  Your  weight  is  stable  at  15  kg,  and  your\n\nheight is still at the 5th centile. Your jaundice is negative, theres no pallor, and your edema has not\n\nworsened.  You  still  have  a  soft  abdomen  with  a  palpable  liver.  The  shifting  dullness  in  your\n\nabdomen suggests ongoing ascites.\"\n\nPatient: \"I see. Is everything else looking fine?\"\n\nDoctor:  \"Your  liver  enzymes  have  been  monitored,  and  the  autoimmune  profile  remains  negative.\n\nThe ultrasound and CT scans still show signs of hepatomegaly and altered liver structure, consistent\n\nwith Budd-Chiari syndrome.\"\n\nPatient: \"Whats the next step?\"\n\nDoctor: \"Well do a Fibroscan to check the liver stiffness. Well also collect some more baseline tests,\n\nincluding a blood group, crossmatch, and viral serology. You need to avoid salt and continue your\n\nmedications.  We  are  also  planning  for  an  endoscopy  to  evaluate  for  esophageal  varices  and\n\ngastropathy.\"\n\nFollow-Up Visit (03.09.2024)\n\nPatient:  \"Doctor,  my  abdominal  distension  has  been  getting  worse  for  the  past  few  days.  Ive  also\n\nhad some steatorrhea.\"\n\n\fDoctor: \"Thank you for the update. It seems like your symptoms are progressing. Your weight is up\n\nto 16 kg, and your height is 112 cm, but your liver function is still impaired. The Fibroscan results\n\nshowed F0 stage, indicating no significant fibrosis, but your ascites and jaundice are still a concern.\"\n\nPatient: \"What are the latest lab results?\"\n\nDoctor: \"Your Protein C is at 49, Protein S at 79, and Anti-thrombin III at 118, which are a bit low.\n\nWe are still waiting on your IgG levels. Your autoimmune profile is negative, and both HBsAg and\n\nAnti-HCV tests remain negative.\"\n\nPatient: \"I still have the same medications, right?\"\n\nDoctor:  \"Yes,  you  continue  on  spironolactone,  omeprazole,  ora  AD  drops,  and  vitamin  K.  Ive\n\nadjusted  your  spironolactone  to  12.5  mg  twice  daily,  and  we  will  add  furosemide  to  help  with  fluid\n\nretention.\"\n\nPatient: \"Whats the next step, doctor?\"\n\nDoctor: \"Well monitor your serum IgG levels and proceed with an endoscopy to check for varices.\n\nWell  also  follow  up  in  a  few  days  for  anesthesia  and  pre-procedure  workup  for  your  upcoming\n\nprocedure.\"\n\nEndoscopy Report (10.09.2024)\n\nDoctor:  \"Your  endoscopy  today  showed  grade  2  esophageal  varices  without  red  signs,  which  is\n\nimportant  to  manage.  Well  continue  with  your  current  treatment  plan  and  monitor  for  any\n\n\fcomplications. Keep up with the low-salt diet and your medications.\"\n\nFollow-Up Visit (30.09.2024)\n\nPatient: \"Doctor, Ive been feeling worse again. Ive had loose stools for the last two days, along with\n\nabdominal pain, vomiting, and fever.\"\n\nDoctor: \"It seems like theres a worsening of your symptoms. Your weight remains stable, and your\n\nheight is still at the 50th centile. Youre still showing signs of ascites and jaundice is absent, but there\n\nare some changes we need to keep an eye on.\"\n\nPatient: \"What are the current lab results?\"\n\nDoctor: \"The lab results are mostly unchanged, with your protein levels still low. The endoscopy on\n\n10th September confirmed grade 2 esophageal varices, and your ultrasound and CT scans remain\n\nconsistent with the previous findings of hepatomegaly and ascites.\"\n\nPatient: \"Whats the plan now, doctor?\"\n\nDoctor:  \"We  will  continue  your  treatment  and  ensure  you  follow  a  strict  salt-free  diet.  You  need  to\n\nstay on your current medications, and we will repeat some tests, including CBC, liver function tests,\n\nand renal function tests, to monitor your progress. We will also keep an eye on your protein levels\n\nand plan for further interventions if needed.\"\n\n\f",

How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Ive been experiencing generalized abdominal pain. Its been bothering me for a while now.\n\nDoctor:  I  see.  Lets  go  through  your  history  a  bit  more.  So,  youre  12  years  old  and  weigh  38  kg,\n\nwhich is above the 25th percentile for your age. Is that correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, thats right.\n\nDoctor: And you live in Vehari. Do you have any siblings?\n\nPatient: Yes, I have two older sisters and one older brother. My brother and one of my sisters have\n\nbeen diagnosed with celiac disease.\n\nDoctor: Okay. Now, from what I understand, you were in your usual state of health until you were\n\naround four years old, in 2016, when you developed pain and tenderness in your right abdomen. An\n\nabdominal  ultrasound  suggested  that  you  might  have  Budd-Chiari  Syndrome.  Does  that  sound\n\nfamiliar?\n\nPatient: Yes, thats correct. The doctors told my family that I had Budd-Chiari Syndrome at that time.\n\nDoctor: Since then, have you had any complications like liver issues, swelling, or anything else?\n\n\fPatient: No, I havent had any major complications so far, but I do have some ongoing issues with\n\nabdominal pain.\n\nDoctor: I see. Ill also go over your medical background briefly. You've been hospitalized before for\n\nthis  condition,  but  your  surgical  history  is  unremarkable.  In  terms  of  family  history,  two  of  your\n\nsiblings  have  celiac  disease.  Your  birth  history  and  vaccination  history  are  normal,  and  your\n\ndevelopment has been on track.\n\nPatient: Yes, everything is fine with that.\n\nDoctor:  Great.  Let's  move  on  to  your  current  medications.  Youre  taking  Tab  Inderal  10  mg  twice\n\ndaily, Cap Evion 250 mg once daily, D-Max drops 3 drops once daily, Tab Aldactone 25 mg once\n\ndaily, and folic acid. Is that correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, thats correct.\n\nDoctor: Now, Ive also looked at your recent lab results. Heres what I found:\n\nBilirubin: 1.3\n\nALT: 58\n\nAST: 42\n\nINR: 1.4\n\n\fHemoglobin: 9.4\n\nWhite Blood Cell count: 3.8\n\nPlatelets: 215\n\nSodium: 135\n\nPotassium: 4.4\n\nUrea: 31\n\nCreatinine: 0.6\n\nPatient: What do those results mean, doctor?\n\nDoctor:  Your  bilirubin  and  liver  enzymes  are  slightly  elevated,  but  nothing  alarming.  Your\n\nhemoglobin is a little low, which might explain some fatigue or weakness. Well keep an eye on that.\n\nYour kidney function seems fine, though, as your creatinine and urea levels are normal.\n\nPatient: Okay, I understand.\n\nDoctor: In terms of radiology, your recent ultrasound of the abdomen shows a mildly enlarged liver\n\nwith  a  few  varices  in  the  hypertrophied  caudate  lobe.  Theres  also  a  chronic  thrombus  in  the  main\n\nhepatic veins, which is consistent with the sequelae of Budd-Chiari Syndrome.\n\nPatient: I see. Is that serious?\n\n\fDoctor:  It's  something  we  need  to  monitor  closely.  We  also  have  some  old  CT  scan  findings  that\n\nsuggest narrowing and stretching of the IVC and intra-hepatic veins, which is part of the Budd-Chiari\n\npicture.\n\nPatient: Okay, so whats the next step, doctor?\n\nDoctor: Were going to do some further screenings. First, we need a full financial screening, and after\n\nthat, well start a baseline workup for chronic liver disease. A CT triphasic will be done to rule out any\n\nsigns of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and well also do an ultrasound shearwave study. A liver\n\nbiopsy is also part of the plan.\n\nFollow-up Visit on 10/06/2024\n\nDoctor: How are you doing today, Husnain?\n\nPatient:  Im  feeling  a  bit  better.  The  abdominal  pain  has  improved,  but  I  still  get  some  intermittent\n\npain in my left lumbar region, especially after meals. It resolves on its own though.\n\nDoctor: Thats good to hear that the pain has improved. Have you had any other issues?\n\nPatient: Not really, but I did stop taking warfarin about 1.5 months ago. I was on it regularly since\n\n2017, but Dr. Tariq decided to stop it.\n\nDoctor: Okay, I see. Any signs of complications like ascites or swelling?\n\nPatient: No, I havent had any ascites since the last episode, and I feel okay otherwise.\n\n\fDoctor: Alright, so your weight is now 39 kg, still above the 25th percentile for your age. Let's check\n\nyour clinical exam. Your general examination is unremarkable, but I noticed neck swelling again. No\n\njaundice or pallor, and you have no edema.\n\nPatient: Yes, the neck swelling has been there for a while.\n\nDoctor: Your liver is slightly enlarged by 1 cm, and your spleen is 5 cm enlarged as well, but theres\n\nno ascites.\n\nPatient: Okay, so whats the next step, doctor?\n\nDoctor: Well continue with your current medications, which include:\n\nTab Propranolol 20 mg twice daily\n\nCap Evion 250 mg once daily\n\nD-Max drops 3 drops once daily\n\nTab Spironolactone 25 mg once daily\n\nFolic acid 1 tablet once daily\n\nPedia Max drops 5 drops once daily\n\nLysovit syrup 5 ml once daily\n\n\fYoull also need some further tests. Your ceruloplasmin is normal at 32, but your IgG is low at 1.61.\n\nANA is positive at 1.80, but autoimmune screening came back negative.\n\nPatient: What does all that mean?\n\nDoctor:  The  low  IgG  could  suggest  some  immune  issues,  but  well  monitor  it.  The  ANA  positivity\n\nneeds to be tracked as well, though theres no direct indication of autoimmune disease right now.\n\nPatient: I understand.\n\nDoctor: Weve scheduled an EGD for tomorrow, and your celiac screening is also in process. Were\n\ndoing a protein C and anti-thrombin test as well as some blood grouping. Youll be admitted to day\n\ncare for the EGD, and youll need to be NPO after 2 AM tonight. Ive booked an intravenous drip for\n\nyou during the procedure as well.\n\nFollow-up Visit on 29/07/2024\n\nDoctor: How have you been since your last visit?\n\nPatient: Ive been doing okay, but I had a chest pain episode on 15/06/2024. It was on the left side,\n\nand  I  had  difficulty  breathing  and  sweating.  I  went  to  a  nearby  hospital  where  they  did  an  ECG,\n\nwhich  showed  inverted  T-waves  in  leads  V2,  V3,  and  V4.  They  gave  me  aspirin,  clopidogrel,  and\n\nheparin, which helped relieve the pain.\n\nDoctor:  That  sounds  worrying.  Im  glad  you  felt  better  after  the  treatment.  Weve  also  kept  track  of\n\nyour medications, and I see youre on aspirin and glyceryl trinitrate now.\n\n\fPatient: Yes, Im taking them daily.\n\nDoctor:  Well  keep  monitoring  your  heart  and  liver  condition.  Your  weight  is  now  39  kg,  and  your\n\ngeneral  examination  remains  unremarkable.  No  jaundice,  pallor,  or  edema.  Your  liver  and  spleen\n\nare still enlarged.\n\nPatient: So, whats next?\n\nDoctor:  The  plan  includes  continuing  your  medications  and  doing  more  screenings  for  your\n\ncondition.  Well  need  to  follow  up  closely,  especially  with  your  liver  disease  and  heart  function.  Im\n\nalso reviewing your radiology and lab findings.\n\n\f",

What brings you in?\n\nPatient:\n\nIve  had  hematemesis  and  melena  for  the  last  two  months,  about  3-4  episodes.  I  was  admitted  in\n\nPeshawar where they did an OGD and applied 4 bands.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI see. What medications were you prescribed after that?\n\nPatient:\n\nI was started on Inderal 2 tabs twice daily and Spiromide 20 mg once daily.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThank you for sharing that. We also did a CT scan, which showed a suspicion of Caroli disease. We\n\nperformed an ultrasound of the abdomen, which showed a normal caliber portal vein and CBD. How\n\nare you feeling now?\n\nPatient:\n\nIm actually asymptomatic for the past two months. No issues with jaundice, abdominal distension,\n\nperipheral edema, petechiae, or bruises.\n\n\fDoctor:\n\nGood to hear. On examination, I noticed the liver is enlarged by 5 cm, and the spleen is enlarged by\n\n2 cm. The left lobe of the liver is palpable.\n\nPatient:\n\nOkay.\n\nDoctor:\n\nLets proceed with some tests to investigate further. Well do a CBC, LFTs, PT/INR, RFTs, Hepatitis\n\nB, Anti-HCV, ANA, IGA, IGG, IGM, Ceruloplasmin, and a slit-lamp examination. Id also like to get a\n\nCT triphasic, ultrasound of the abdomen, EGD, and possibly a liver biopsy.\n\nPatient:\n\nSounds good. What should I do in the meantime?\n\nDoctor:\n\nYou  should  follow  a  salt  restriction  diet  and  eat  egg  whites.  Continue  your  current  medications  for\n\nnow. After we get the lab results, we will plan for the EGD and liver biopsy.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYour slit-lamp eye examination for Kayser-Fleischer rings was negative. We can now proceed with\n\nscheduling your EGD and liver biopsy.\n\nPatient:\n\nThank you.\n\nDoctor:\n\n\fOn  your  follow-up  visit,  you  mentioned  no  active  complaints.  There  has  been  no  hematemesis  or\n\nmelena, and youre not experiencing any fever or jaundice, correct?\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, that's right.\n\nDoctor:\n\nGood.  You're  still  taking  your  usual  medications:  Inderal  20  mg  twice  daily,  Spiromide  20/50  mg\n\nonce daily, and Risek sachets for two weeks. During your examination, I noted no jaundice or pallor.\n\nYour left lobe of the liver is still palpable, and the spleen is 3 cm palpable. Your chest sounds clear\n\nbilaterally, and theres no ascites.\n\nPatient:\n\nOkay.\n\nDoctor:\n\nHere are your lab results:\n\nWBC: 4.9\n\nHb: 12\n\nPlatelets: 138\n\nTotal Bilirubin: 1.23\n\nALT: 31\n\n\fAST: 43\n\nALP: 285\n\nGGT: 65\n\nAlbumin: 4.29\n\nUrea: 16\n\nCreatinine: 0.5\n\nNa: 139\n\nK: 4\n\nCl: 99\n\nPT: 14.8\n\nINR: 1.14\n\nThe CT triphasic results suggest primary biliary cholangitis or primary sclerosing cholangitis. Theres\n\nalso a small soft tissue nodule in the periampullary region, possibly a polyp. Further evaluation with\n\nMRCP and ERCP, with possible tissue sampling, is recommended.\n\n\fPatient:\n\nWhats the next step?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWell  proceed  with  an  EGD  tomorrow  and  also  consult  regarding  a  liver  transplant.  We'll  perform\n\nfurther  tests,  including  CBC,  LFTs,  RFTs,  PT/INR,  and  COVID-19  testing.  We  will  also  need  to\n\ncross-match your blood.\n\nPatient:\n\nOkay, I understand.\n\nDoctor:\n\nOn your next follow-up, you were admitted for surveillance and an EGD procedure. Youre still taking\n\nyour medications as usual. Your blood pressure was 106/60, and your heart rate was 117.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, thats correct.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThe plan includes MRCP tomorrow, along with CBC, INR, LFTs, RFTs, SE, and COVID-19 antigen\n\ntests. You will be seen by Dr. Iqtidar, Dr. Seerat, and Dr. Ali tomorrow.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYour  follow-up  visit  on  27th  September  showed  no  active  complaints.  The  EGD  was  completed\n\nearlier this year, and youve been prescribed the following:\n\nInderal 10 mg twice daily\n\n\fSpiromide 50/20 mg once-half tablet twice daily\n\nIndrop D injection once every two months\n\nFor  today,  youre  scheduled  for  surveillance  endoscopy.  The  anesthesia  consult  is  arranged,  and\n\nyour lab work will include CBC, LFTs, RFTs, S/E, PT/INR, and an abdominal ultrasound.\n\nPatient:\n\nGot it.\n\nDoctor:\n\nAfter the endoscopy, well optimize your medication as follows:\n\nInderal 30 mg twice daily\n\nSpiromide 50/20 mg once-half tablet twice daily\n\nWell schedule your next follow-up for endoscopy in 6 weeks.\n\nPatient:\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\n\f",

About\n\n3.5  months  ago,  I  started  having  abdominal  distension.  I  was  initially  treated  in  Vihari,  and  I  was\n\nfound to have low hemoglobin, so I was transfused with 3 PCVs. Later, I was referred to CHL, where\n\nthey diagnosed me with Budd-Chiari syndrome based on a CT scan. Now Ive been referred to PKLI\n\nfor a liver transplant evaluation.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI see, that sounds quite serious. You mentioned abdominal distension and your hemoglobin being\n\nlow. Have you had any other symptoms?\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, I also have jaundice and ascites. Apart from that, nothing else really.\n\nDoctor:\n\nOkay, let's go over your medical history. Anything notable there?\n\nPatient:\n\nNo,  everything  is  normal.  I  was  born  via  C-section  at  term,  and  everything  went  fine.  Ive  had  no\n\nmajor surgeries, and my family history is unremarkable. I am on a salt-free diet, and my vaccinations\n\nare up to date.\n\n\fDoctor:\n\nGood to hear. Now, Ill check your examination details. You are 148 cm tall and weigh 35 kg, which\n\nis  above  the  10th  percentile  for  height  but  below  the  5th  percentile  for  weight.  Your  jaundice  and\n\npallor are visible. No edema though, which is good. Your liver is 7 cm below the costal margin, hard\n\nconsistency,  and  your  spleen  is  slightly  enlarged.  Your  abdominal  veins  are  dilated,  and  there's\n\nshifting dullness.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, thats what I feel too.\n\nDoctor:\n\nLets  review  your  lab  results.  The  bilirubin  levels  were  0.87  and  now  1.6.  Your  hemoglobin  has\n\ndropped from 9.8 to 4.62. Your platelet count was 201, and now its 115. Your sodium and potassium\n\nlevels are somewhat low, and your albumin is at 3.2. Well need to follow up on these levels closely.\n\nPatient:\n\nOkay, doctor. I trust you. Whats the plan moving forward?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWere going to run a few more tests, including CBC, liver function tests, renal function tests, and viral\n\nserology. Well also test for protein C, protein S, anti-thrombin III, and check your blood group. Ill also\n\norder  an  ultrasound  today  and  a  CT  triphasic  on  Monday,  as  well  as  an  ultrasound  shearwave  if\n\ntheres no ascites. Ill need to see you for a follow-up on Monday. Youll stay on your salt-free diet for\n\nnow, and we may schedule an EGD on Tuesday if the lab results are normal.\n\nYour current medications include:\n\n\fORA AD: 4 drops once daily\n\nSpironolactone 25mg: 3 times daily\n\nK-Lot injection 5mg: once weekly\n\nInderal 10mg: 3 times daily\n\nDoes that sound alright?\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, thats fine. Thank you.\n\nPatient Visit: 29.07.24 - Follow-up Visit in Paediatric Gastroenterology\n\nPatient:\n\nDoctor, Im here for my follow-up. Ive been doing okay, no major complaints right now.\n\nDoctor:\n\nGlad to hear that. Let me check your details again. Your height is still above the 10th percentile, but\n\nyour weight remains below the 5th percentile. Jaundice and pallor are still present, but no edema.\n\nYour  liver  is  now  6  cm  below  the  costal  margin,  and  the  consistency  is  still  hard.  You  still  have\n\ndilated superficial veins, and your spleen is enlarged by 6 cm with shifting dullness.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, I noticed the same.\n\n\fDoctor:\n\nWeve reviewed your lab results. Your WBC is 6.69, hemoglobin has dropped further to 6.5, and your\n\nplatelet count is 198. Your protein C, protein S, and anti-thrombin III levels are still low, with values\n\nof 67, 75, and 84, respectively. Well need to address these and monitor closely.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhat does that mean, doctor?\n\nDoctor:\n\nIt means we need to keep monitoring your clotting factors and ensure were addressing any issues\n\nthere. Ive also reviewed your CT triphasic and ultrasound results. The CT scan still shows features\n\nconsistent with Budd-Chiari syndrome, with some mild to moderate ascites. Your ultrasound shows\n\nhepatosplenomegaly, altered liver parenchyma, and caudate lobe hypertrophy.\n\nPatient:\n\nIt seems quite complicated.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYes, it is, but we have a solid plan. We will consult with the anesthesia team before proceeding with\n\nany  procedures.  Well  also  need  to  transfuse  300  ml  of  packed  RBCs  and  administer  furosemide\n\nduring the transfusion. Im also planning an ultrasound shearwave for you.\n\nPatient:\n\nThat sounds good, doctor. I trust your plan.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYoull continue on the current medications:\n\n\fORA AD: 4 drops once daily\n\nSpironolactone 25 mg: 3 times daily\n\nK-Lot injection 5 mg: once weekly\n\nInderal 10 mg: 3 times daily\n\nOmeprazole 30 mg: once daily\n\nEvion 1 capsule: once daily\n\nWell also start furosemide 5 mg twice daily and continue with a salt-free diet.\n\nPatient:\n\nThank you, doctor. Ill follow your instructions.\n\nPatient Visit: 27.08.24 - Follow-up Visit in Paediatric Gastroenterology\n\nPatient:\n\nDoctor, Im back for another follow-up. I feel okay, no major issues.\n\nDoctor:\n\nGood to hear. Lets check your details. Your height is still above the 10th percentile, but your weight\n\nis  still  below  the  5th  percentile.  Your  jaundice  is  mild,  and  your  pallor  is  still  present.  There's  no\n\nedema. Your liver is now 3-4 cm below the costal margin, with hard consistency. The spleen is 10\n\n\fcm below the costal margin, and there's shifting dullness, with mild ascites.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, thats accurate.\n\nDoctor:\n\nLets  go  over  your  lab  results.  Your  hemoglobin  is  still  low  at  6.5,  but  your  platelet  count  has\n\nremained stable at 198. The INR is 1.04, and the levels of protein C, protein S, and anti-thrombin III\n\nare still low.\n\nPatient:\n\nI see. What does this mean for me?\n\nDoctor:\n\nIt means that we need to continue closely monitoring your clotting factors and anemia. Weve also\n\nreviewed  your  CT  and  ultrasound  findings,  and  theyre  still  suggestive  of  Budd-Chiari  syndrome.\n\nThere's no focal hepatic lesion, but you still have moderate ascites.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhats the next step, doctor?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWell  continue  monitoring  your  condition  with  further  tests.  An  EGD  was  done,  and  the  results\n\nshowed normal mucosa with grade 1 varices. Your current medications are:\n\nORA AD: 4 drops once daily\n\n\fSpironolactone 50 mg: twice daily\n\nK-Lot injection 5 mg: once weekly\n\nInderal 10 mg: 3 times daily\n\nOmeprazole 30 mg: once daily\n\nEvion 1 capsule: once daily\n\nFurosemide 5 mg: twice daily\n\nFor now, well maintain this regimen, and Id like to follow up with a USG shearwave today. Well also\n\ndiscuss  the  possibility  of  starting  Rivaroxaban,  and  you'll  continue  with  your  salt-free  diet.  Please\n\ncome back in 3 months.\n\nPatient:\n\nThank you so much, doctor. I will follow your advice.\n\n\f",

I weigh 16.20 kg, and Im from Mianwali. I have five\n\nsiblings,  all  of  whom  are  healthy.  My  family  history  is  unremarkable,  and  I  was  born  via  normal\n\nvaginal  delivery  at  term  with  no  complications.  Im  up-to-date  with  all  my  vaccinations,  and  my\n\ndevelopment has been normal.\n\nDoctor:\n\nHello, Dua. I see you are here today for an opinion. Can you tell me more about your health history?\n\nPatient:\n\nI  had  some  issues  about  a  year  ago,  when  I  was  in  the  U.S.  I  developed  abdominal  pain  and\n\nswelling. My doctors there referred me to Mianwali because my liver was enlarged. They did some\n\ntests, and then I was sent to the Childrens Hospital Lahore (CHL). I also have a history of fits, which\n\nIm still dealing with.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI understand. How has your liver been since then? Have you noticed anything unusual like ascites\n\n(fluid buildup)?\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, I do have ascites. The doctors have been monitoring it. They diagnosed me with cryptogenic\n\nliver cirrhosis and autoimmune hepatitis. My past surgeries have been unremarkable, and theres no\n\n\fremarkable family history of similar conditions.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThank  you  for  sharing  that  with  me.  Lets  take  a  look  at  your  lab  results  from  earlier  tests.  Your\n\nbilirubin levels are normal, but your ALT and AST are elevated, which indicates some liver stress.\n\nYour INR is 1.13, which is within the normal range. Well need to monitor these closely.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYour abdominal ultrasound from June showed altered liver texture with gross ascites, and your CT\n\nscan results confirmed a congested liver. Your liver biopsy from July showed chronic hepatitis with\n\nminimal activity and cirrhosis. No malignancy was found, which is a good sign.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYour medications currently include Carveda, Spiromide, and Vitamin K, which are helping manage\n\nyour  condition.  You  will  also  continue  with  these  medications  as  we  proceed  with  your  treatment\n\nplan.\n\nDoctor:\n\nBased  on  your  condition,  we  will  need  to  conduct  a  few  more  tests.  Id  recommend  checking  for\n\nANA,  IgG,  ceruloplasmin,  and  24-hour  urinary  copper  levels.  A  liver  transplant  is  likely  to  be  the\n\ndefinitive  treatment  for  you.  We  will  also  need  to  perform  a  follow-up  abdominal  ultrasound,  CT\n\nscan, and EGD from CHL.\n\nDoctor:\n\nIn the meantime, you will need to follow a salt-free diet. Your medications will continue as they are,\n\nbut please bring a donor for your next visit. It will be important to have a donor who is 18 or older, as\n\nthe prospective donor is currently 15 years old.\n\n\fFollow-Up Visit on 29th August, 2023:\n\nPatient:\n\nHello, doctor. Im Dua Fatima again. I have been feeling feverish with abdominal distension.\n\nDoctor:\n\nLets  check  your  condition.  I  notice  grade  1  clubbing  and  some  prominent  superficial  veins  in  your\n\nabdomen.  Your  liver  is  palpable,  but  theres  no  ascites  at  the  moment.  Your  CT  scan  from  30th\n\nAugust confirms hepatosplenomegaly with a congested liver and ascites.\n\nDoctor:\n\nWe also did an ultrasound, which showed that your liver is enlarged with a heterogeneous texture,\n\nand  the  caudate  lobe  is  prominent.  Your  liver  biopsy  from  July  confirmed  chronic  hepatitis  with\n\ncirrhosis,  but  no  malignancy  was  detected.  Your  liver  is  still  under  significant  stress,  and  the\n\ntreatments will continue to focus on managing that.\n\nDoctor:\n\nWe will continue with your salt-free diet, and Im prescribing Aldactone and Inderal to help manage\n\nyour liver function. Please take the recommended medications for constipation and other supportive\n\ncare.  We  will  be  referring  you  to  the  liver  transplant  team  regarding  the  donor  workup.  If  you\n\nexperience any changes, please contact us.\n\nFollow-Up Visit on 6th September, 2023:\n\nPatient:\n\nDoctor, Ive been having a fever and abdominal distension again. My condition seems a bit worse.\n\n\fDoctor:\n\nLets  check  you  over.  You  still  have  grade  1  clubbing,  but  your  liver  is  now  3  cm  below  the  costal\n\nmargin,  and  ascites  has  returned.  Well  continue  monitoring  your  liver  function  with  Aldactone  and\n\nInderal, and Im adding Vitamin K as well.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI see that we need to proceed with more lab tests, including Protein C, Antithrombin III, CBC, LFT,\n\nand INR. Well follow up with you after 10 days and adjust treatments accordingly.\n\nFollow-Up Visit on 18th September, 2023:\n\nPatient:\n\nHello,  doctor.  Im  feeling  much  better  now.  My  condition  has  stabilized,  and  Im  not  having  fever\n\nanymore.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThats good to hear. You are still an active and alert child. We have reviewed your lab results, and I\n\nsee youre doing better. The ultrasound from 22nd August confirmed an enlarged liver with nodular\n\nechotexture, but theres no ascites at the moment. The CT scan from 30th August showed signs of\n\nBudd Chiari Syndrome along with chronic liver disease changes.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYour  Shearwave  elastography  from  18th  September  indicates  F4  stage  of  hepatic  fibrosis,  so  we\n\nneed  to  continue  careful  monitoring  of  your  liver.  Youre  doing  well  on  your  medications,  and  well\n\nproceed with your next steps.\n\n\fFollow-Up Visit on 24th October, 2023:\n\nPatient:\n\nDoctor, Im back for my follow-up. Ive been feeling fine, except for a few issues with mouth ulcers.\n\nDoctor:\n\nIts good to hear that youre feeling well. Your condition still shows signs of Budd Chiari Syndrome,\n\nbut no new issues have arisen. Well continue to monitor your liver function closely with ultrasound\n\nand regular checkups.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYour  latest  ultrasound  shows  an  enlarged  liver  with  a  heterogeneous  texture  and  ascites,  but  well\n\nmonitor  these  developments.  Well  repeat  the  EGD  after  a  year  and  continue  managing  your\n\nmedications.\n\nOverall Plan Moving Forward:\n\nContinue with current medications: Aldactone, Inderal, and Vitamin K.\n\nMaintain a salt-free diet.\n\nFollow up with liver transplant team and donor workup.\n\nMonitor liver function with regular tests and imaging.\n\nRepeat EGD in a year.\n\n\fEnd of Visit Summary:\n\nWe are working closely on your liver transplant evaluation, and well keep an eye on your condition\n\nwith regular follow-ups. If you feel any changes or discomfort, please contact us right away.\n\n\f",

    "raw_text": "Gender: Female\n\nAge: 51\n\nMRN: 602927\n\nDiagnosis: Hepatic fibrosis\n\nHistory and Physical:\n\nDoctor:  Hello,  I  understand  you're  here  today  with  some  concerns  regarding  your  health.  Can  you\n\ntell me what brought you in?\n\nPatient:  I  have  been  experiencing  pain  in  my  right  hypochondrium  for  the  past  two  weeks.  Along\n\nwith that, I have intermittent fever, severe pruritus, and vomiting that has been ongoing since 2008.\n\nDoctor: I see. You mentioned the pain in the right hypochondrium is recent, but theres a history of\n\npruritus and vomiting. How long has this been an issue for you?\n\nPatient:  Yes,  the  pruritus  and  vomiting  have  been  persistent  since  2008.  Ive  had  work-ups  done\n\nbefore  which  suggested  a  possible  liver  carcinoma,  but  the  liver  biopsy  I  had  back  then  was\n\nnegative for any malignancy.\n\nDoctor:  Thank  you  for  sharing  that.  Based  on  the  symptoms  you  mentioned  and  your  history,  Ive\n\nreviewed the recent CT scan of your abdomen. It shows multiple patchy arterialized tumors in your\n\nright liver lobe, which involves segments 5, 6, 7, 8, 4a, and 4b, and extends into the caudate lobe.\n\nThere is also some concern about invasion of the right portal vein branch. However, the left portal\n\nvein and main portal vein are patent, and there is no sign of ascites. Does that sound familiar?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds similar to what I was told. What are the next steps from here?\n\nDoctor:  Given  the  extent  of  the  disease,  we  need  to  consider  surgery.  A  right  extended\n\n\fhepatectomy, or liver resection, could be a potential treatment option, but I must inform you that it's\n\na high-risk surgery, with a 5-10% chance of complications leading to mortality. Alternatively, if you\n\nchoose not to undergo surgery, a liver biopsy may be performed to gather further information. Does\n\nthat sound like something you'd like to pursue?\n\nPatient:  I  understand.  What  additional  tests  should  I  get  done  to  help  with  the  decision-making\n\nprocess?\n\nDoctor: I would advise you to undergo a few additional tests to get a clearer picture. These include:\n\nHRCT of the chest\n\nCA 19-9\n\nCA-125\n\nCEA (Carcinoembryonic Antigen)\n\nAFP (Alpha-Fetoprotein)\n\nOnce these investigations are completed, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the\n\nnext steps. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Yes, that makes sense. Ill get the tests done as advised.\n\nDoctor: Excellent. Ill also need to review your previous lab results to monitor your condition further.\n\nHeres what we have from your latest labs on 17.03.21:\n\n\fHemoglobin (HB): 11.0\n\nTotal Leukocyte Count (TLC): 8.4\n\nPlatelets (PLT): 509\n\nTotal Bilirubin (T-BIL): 0.8\n\nDirect Bilirubin (D-BIL): 0.5\n\nALT/AST: 108/78\n\nALP: 411\n\nAlbumin: 4.0\n\nCreatinine: 0.7\n\nSodium (Na+): Not provided\n\nPotassium (K+): Not provided\n\nINR: Not provided\n\nESR: 95\n\n\fDoctor:  Based  on  these  values,  there  are  a  few  concerns.  For  instance,  your  liver  enzymes  (ALT\n\nand AST) are elevated, which might indicate ongoing liver dysfunction. Also, your platelets are quite\n\nhigh, which may be related to the underlying liver issue. Well keep an eye on all of this during your\n\ntreatment.\n\nPatient:  Thank  you,  doctor.  Ill  get  the  tests  done  and  follow  up  with  you  as  soon  as  I  have  the\n\nresults.\n\n\f",

How have you been feeling since your\n\nlast appointment?\n\nPatient: Im still experiencing abdominal distention, and Ive noticed the swelling hasnt reduced much.\n\nIm continuing the medications you prescribed.\n\nDoctor: I see. Let's go over your medical history and your recent lab results.\n\nPatient: Sure, Doctor.\n\nDoctor:  You  were  born  via  spontaneous  vaginal  delivery  (SVD)  at  term,  and  your  birth  was\n\nuneventful.  You  had  no  major  health  issues  until  you  turned  2.5  years  old,  when  you  developed\n\nabdominal  distension  and  fever.  This  was  treated  at  CMH  Rawalpindi,  where  the  distension\n\nresolved,  but  the  issue  recurred  4  to  5  months  ago  with  fever,  constipation,  and  prominent\n\nsuperficial  veins  on  your  chest.  You  were  then  referred  to  Shifa  Hospital,  where  we  continued  the\n\nevaluation. Youve never experienced jaundice, loose stools, or itching, correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, thats right.\n\nDoctor: You did mention an episode of hypoglycemia that led to a loss of consciousness, but youve\n\nhad no history of seizures. And you've not been taking the prescribed Warfarin for the last 20 days?\n\n\fPatient: Correct, Doctor.\n\nDoctor: Now, lets look at the results from your recent lab work.\n\nLaboratory Results:\n\nBilirubin:\n\n22.01.2024: 1.14 mg/dL\n\n22.03.2024: 0.9 mg/dL\n\nDirect Bilirubin:\n\n22.01.2024: 0.85 mg/dL\n\nALT (Alanine Aminotransferase):\n\n22.01.2024: 81 U/L\n\n22.03.2024: 60 U/L\n\nAST (Aspartate Aminotransferase):\n\n22.01.2024: 156 U/L\n\n22.03.2024: [Data Missing]\n\n\fALP (Alkaline Phosphatase):\n\n22.01.2024: 299 U/L\n\n22.03.2024: 261 U/L\n\nGGT (Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase):\n\n22.01.2024: 234 U/L\n\n22.03.2024: 106 U/L\n\nAlbumin:\n\n22.01.2024: 4.2 g/dL\n\nINR (International Normalized Ratio):\n\n22.01.2024: 1.19\n\nWBC (White Blood Cells):\n\n22.01.2024: 11.98 x10^9/L\n\n22.03.2024: 15 x10^9/L\n\n\fHemoglobin (HB):\n\n22.01.2024: 10.4 g/dL\n\n22.03.2024: 9.7 g/dL\n\nMCV (Mean Corpuscular Volume):\n\n22.01.2024: 84 fL\n\nMCH (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin):\n\n22.01.2024: 24.5 pg\n\nPlatelets (PLT):\n\n22.01.2024: 397 x10^9/L\n\n22.03.2024: 263 x10^9/L\n\nSodium (Na):\n\n22.01.2024: 136 mmol/L\n\nPotassium (K):\n\n22.01.2024: 4.7 mmol/L\n\n\fCreatinine (Cr):\n\n22.01.2024: 0.32 mg/dL\n\nSpecial Tests:\n\nProtein C, Protein S, Anti-Thrombin III, and Factor V Leiden: Normal (Shifa Hospital Notes)\n\nAFP (Alpha-fetoprotein): 3.6 ng/mL\n\nFactor V Leiden: Negative\n\nAPTT (Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time): 32 seconds\n\nDoctor: You also had an ultrasound on 29.12.2023 that showed mild hepatosplenomegaly and mild\n\nto  moderate  ascites.  A  CT  scan  on  the  same  date  showed  hepatomegaly  with  a  flip-flop\n\nenhancement  pattern,  which  is  associated  with  thrombosized  or  fibrosed  hepatic  veins,  and\n\nmoderate ascites. This suggests Budd-Chiari Syndrome. You also had a right-sided hydrocele.\n\nPatient: Yes, I remember. I had some swelling on my abdomen and chest, but no jaundice.\n\nDoctor: That's correct. On physical exam, your weight is still below the 5th percentile at 14 kg. You\n\nhave pallor, but there is no edema. Your liver is palpable 6 cm below the costal margin, and theres\n\nshifting dullness on abdominal exam. The prominent veins extending from your upper abdomen to\n\nover your chest are a significant finding.\n\n\fDoctor:  Based  on  all  these  findings,  including  the  radiological  and  lab  results,  the  most  likely\n\ndiagnosis  is  Budd-Chiari  Syndrome  with  right-sided  hydrocele.  We  will  continue  the  current\n\nmedications you are on, which include spironolactone, furosemide, and the oral drops.\n\nPatient: Okay, Doctor, so what's the plan moving forward?\n\nDoctor:  We  will  keep  you  on  a  salt-free  diet  to  manage  the  ascites.  You  will  continue  with  your\n\ncurrent medications. We need to schedule further tests, including a CT triphasic scan, an ultrasound\n\nshearwave, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Your follow-up is in two weeks, and well\n\nreassess your condition then.\n\n\f",

I see you are 2.5 years old, weighing 12 kg and measuring 87 cm in height. You are\n\nthe  product  of  a  consanguineous  marriage,  and  you  have  two  siblings  who  are  alive  and  healthy.\n\nHowever,  you  had  two  siblings  who  passed  away  due  to  polycystic  kidney  disease.  How  are  you\n\nfeeling today?\n\nPatient's Caregiver (or Parent):\n\nUmer  seems  fine  today,  but  he  has  had  some  past  medical  issues.  He  was  diagnosed  with\n\npolycystic  kidney  disease  at  the  age  of  6  months  after  being  investigated  for  a  minor  illness.  His\n\nsymptoms included abdominal distension at 6-7 months of age. He also experienced hematemesis\n\nand  melena  multiple  times.  He  underwent  endoscopy  with  band  ligation  seven  times,  the  last  one\n\nbeing in May 2022. His most recent episode of upper GI bleeding was in March 2022.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI understand. I can see you have a history of complications due to polycystic kidney disease. Let me\n\nreview  your  previous  lab  results  and  ultrasound.  In  your  last  ultrasound  from  October  2020,  it\n\nshowed  bilateral  cystic  kidney  disease  associated  with  hepatic  fibrosis,  though  there  was  no\n\nevidence of progressive portal hypertension.\n\nCan you share any new symptoms or concerns today?\n\nPatient's Caregiver (or Parent):\n\nNo new complaints today. The only ongoing issue is his abdominal pain, which he has had for the\n\n\flast  15  days.  He  is  on  medications  for  his  condition,  including  Inderal  5  mg  twice  daily  and  Dmax\n\ndrops.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThank you for the update. I will review his recent medical records and tests. His latest blood tests\n\nshow  a  bilirubin  level  of  0.4,  ALT  of  19,  and  ALP  of  70.  His  INR  was  1.07,  which  seems  within\n\nnormal limits. His hemoglobin in March 2022 was 10.0 g/dL, and his platelet count was 151. There is\n\nno  jaundice  or  pallor  observed  in  the  examination.  However,  his  liver  size  is  noted  to  be  slightly\n\nenlarged, with a 3 cm liver span, and his spleen is 2 cm palpable. His abdominal distension and the\n\npresence of ascites are concerning.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI  will  order  repeat  baseline  labs,  including  CBC,  LFTs,  RFTs,  S/E,  INR,  and  ultrasound  of  the\n\nabdomen. We need to monitor his condition closely. Additionally, we may proceed with liver biopsy\n\nas part of his upcoming procedure at the Children's Hospital.\n\nI recommend you follow up in the pediatric nephrology clinic after one month.\n\nDoctor:\n\nHello, Umer. I see you are now 3 years old. Your weight is still 12 kg. You have been diagnosed with\n\nautosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease and congenital hepatic fibrosis. How have you been\n\nfeeling recently?\n\nPatient's Caregiver (or Parent):\n\nUmer is doing well, but he still experiences some abdominal distension. We haven't had any active\n\ncomplaints  recently,  but  his  weight  and  height  are  still  below  the  5th  percentile  for  his  age.  He\n\ncontinues with the same medications: Inderal 10 mg in the morning and 5 mg in the evening, along\n\nwith Dmax drops once daily.\n\n\fDoctor:\n\nIt's good to hear there are no active complaints. During today's examination, Umer has a distended\n\nabdomen with superficial veins and a spleen that is 6 cm palpable. His liver is 1 cm enlarged, and\n\nthere is ascites present. His kidneys are not palpable on bimanual examination.\n\nThe  liver  biopsy  from  May  2023  confirmed  congenital  hepatic  fibrosis,  with  60-70%  of  the  biopsy\n\nvolume showing fibrous bands. There's no evidence of cirrhosis, which is reassuring.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI reviewed his endoscopy results, and the most recent one from May 2023 showed grade II varices\n\nat  the  12  o'clock  position.  Previous  endoscopies  also  showed  grade  1  and  grade  2  varices,  with\n\nbanding applied during several of them.\n\nDoctor:\n\nFor todays follow-up, we will proceed with the necessary investigations including CBC, RFTs, LFTs,\n\nS/E,  and  INR.  We  will  also  repeat  the  urine  C/S  and  urine  R/E.  Given  his  condition,  we  are\n\nconsidering liver transplantation as a definitive treatment.\n\nYou can continue his current medications, and we will schedule follow-up after the lab results.\n\nPlan for Future:\n\nRepeat CBC, LFT, RFT, S/E, INR\n\nUltrasound abdomen and pelvis\n\nLiver biopsy scheduled\n\nContinue current medications (Inderal, Dmax)\n\n\fFollow-up visit in one month after lab tests\n\n\f",

    "raw_text": "Gender: Male\n\nAge: 9\n\nMRN: 808374\n\nDiagnosis: Hepatic fibrosis\n\nHistory and Physical:\n\nDoctor: Hello, how are you today?\n\nPatient's Guardian: We are here for our child's follow-up appointment.\n\nDoctor: Could you please tell me your child's name and age?\n\nPatient's Guardian: His name is Adnan Shafiq, and he is 10 years old.\n\nDoctor: Great, thank you. Let's start with his medical history. What are his presenting complaints?\n\nPatient's Guardian: He has been experiencing malena (dark stool) for the past two weeks.\n\nDoctor: I see. Can you tell me more about his previous medical history?\n\nPatient's Guardian: He had kidney stones at 9 months old, and was operated on for that. Later, he\n\ndeveloped  recurrent  fevers,  and  at  7  years  old,  he  was  diagnosed  with  hepatosplenomegaly  and\n\nunderwent a bone marrow biopsy. After extensive investigations, he was diagnosed with congenital\n\nhepatic fibrosis. He has had two EGDs (Esophagogastroduodenoscopies) done.\n\nDoctor:  Thank  you \n\nfor \n\nthat \n\ninformation.  Does  he  have  any  known  complications  or\n\ndecompensations?\n\n\fPatient's Guardian: Yes, he has had an upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB) and some issues with\n\nhis spleen and liver. He also has pancytopenia.\n\nDoctor:  Understood.  Lets  move  on  to  his  physical  examination.  What  did  you  observe  during  his\n\ncheck-up?\n\nPatient's Guardian: His weight is 25 kg and his height is 131 cm, both above the 25th percentile for\n\nhis age. There was no jaundice, but he has some pallor. His spleen was palpable 12 cm below the\n\ncostal margin, and the liver was also palpable. There was no ascites. His abdomen was distended.\n\nDoctor: Thats noted. How about his current medications?\n\nPatient's  Guardian:  He  is  taking  propranolol  10mg  twice  daily,  omeprazole  10mg  once  daily,  and\n\nmaltofer 5ml once daily.\n\nDoctor:  Now,  let's  look  at  his  recent  lab  results.  The  bilirubin  is  0.4,  ALT  is  45,  AST  and  ALP  are\n\nnormal, albumin is 3.4, and INR is 1.0. His white blood cell count (WBC) is 2.47, hemoglobin (Hb) is\n\n6.6,  and  platelets  (PLT)  are  78.  His  sodium  is  136,  potassium  is  3.96,  and  chloride  is  103.8.  The\n\nreticulocyte count is 2.0, and CRP and procalcitonin are not available.\n\nDoctor: Have there been any recent imaging results?\n\nPatient's Guardian: Yes, we have had a CT scan and an ultrasound done. The ultrasound showed\n\ncoarse  liver  and  splenomegaly.  The  CT  scan,  done  on  29th  August,  showed  a  small  liver  with\n\nirregular  serrated  margins,  capsular  retraction,  splenomegaly,  and  dilated  portal  veins.  It  also\n\nindicated varices and minimal ascites.\n\n\fDoctor: Based on all of this, the diagnosis is congenital hepatic fibrosis with portal hypertension. We\n\nwill  continue  the  current  treatment  with  propranolol  and  omeprazole,  and  monitor  him  closely.  His\n\nupcoming appointments are for an EGD on October 1st and liver biopsy in one month.\n\nPatient's Guardian: Thank you, doctor.\n\nDoctor: You're welcome. Please follow up after the planned tests, and we will adjust the treatment\n\nas needed.\n\nPlan Summary:\n\nEGD scheduled for 1st October 2024.\n\nLiver biopsy scheduled in one month.\n\nContinue propranolol 10mg BID, omeprazole 10mg daily, and maltofer 5ml daily.\n\nMonitor lab results closely, including liver function and hemoglobin levels.\n\nFinancial screening and baseline liver disease work-up planned.\n\n\f",

We're  here  for  a  follow-up  regarding  my  son,  Jawad  Hussain.  Hes  7  years  old  and\n\nweighs  16  kg,  standing  at  105  cm.  He  is  from  Gujrat,  and  he  has  two  siblings,  one  of  whom  is\n\nhealthy. His birth was by C-section, and theres no known family history of any medical conditions.\n\nDoctor:\n\nAlright,  I  see.  Could  you  please  tell  me  more  about  his  condition  and  any  symptoms  hes  been\n\nexperiencing?\n\nPatient's Mother:\n\nYes, Jawad has been suffering from abdominal distension for the last six months. About six months\n\nago,  he  developed  this  distension  along  with  some  mild  pain.  We  initially  went  to  a  nearby  clinic,\n\nwhere  an  ultrasound  showed  hepatomegaly  and  altered  liver  echotexture.  He  was  referred  to\n\nChildrens Hospital, where they did some lab tests and performed an endoscopy. A liver biopsy was\n\nattempted but couldnt be completed due to bleeding concerns. Recently, I noticed two episodes of\n\nblood in his stool, about 2-3 ml of fresh blood after he passed stool, but it was painless, and there\n\nhasnt been any other bleeding elsewhere. He also had high-grade fever with variations throughout\n\nthe  day,  especially  at  night,  and  a  dry  cough.  The  symptoms  improved  after  we  started  some\n\nmedications prescribed by a local doctor.\n\n\fDoctor:\n\nThank you for explaining. I see that Jawads condition is quite serious. Do you have any history of\n\ncomplications or hospitalizations?\n\nPatient's Mother:\n\nYes, he was admitted to Childrens Hospital one month ago and three months ago as well. He has\n\nbeen  diagnosed  with  hepatic  fibrosis  based  on  an  ultrasound  performed  in  July  2023,  and  there\n\nhave been some decompensations like abdominal distension and mild pelvic ascites back in July.\n\nDoctor:\n\nUnderstood. Lets go ahead and check his current status. During the examination, I observed that his\n\nweight  and  height  are  below  the  25th  and  5th  percentiles,  respectively.  There  was  no  jaundice,\n\npallor,  or  edema.  His  liver  is  four  fingers  below  the  costal  margin,  and  its  firm  in  consistency.  The\n\nspleen is also palpable, about three fingers below the subcostal margin. His abdomen is distended,\n\nwith a prominent abdominal vein. I did not find any tenderness, but his liver and spleen could not be\n\nprecisely measured due to the tense abdomen.\n\nPatient's Mother:\n\nThats correct. He seems to be sleeping a lot lately and doesnt respond well to pain or stimuli. Hes\n\nnot very oriented either.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThank you for that. We will continue monitoring him closely. Ive gone through his recent lab results\n\nand previous tests. His bilirubin is at 1.10, ALT is 16, ALP is 432, albumin is 3.4, INR is 1.17, WBC\n\ncount  is  8.14,  hemoglobin  is  11.44,  and  platelets  are  244.  His  Hepatitis  B  surface  antigen  and\n\nanti-HCV tests were negative as of July 2023.\n\n\fPatient's Mother:\n\nYes, we had those tests done, and they came back negative.\n\nDoctor:\n\nGreat. As for the endoscopy, the last procedure on 27th July 2023 showed grade 2 varices with no\n\ngastroenteropathy,  and  one  band  was  applied.  The  follow-up  endoscopy  on  12th  October  2023\n\nshowed  grade  1  varices  with  moderate  to  severe  gastroenteropathy.  Based  on  the  ultrasound\n\nperformed on 15th July 2023, it was noted that his liver was enlarged, measuring 13 cm, with altered\n\nechogenicity. The spleen size was 9 cm. His diagnosis of congenital hepatic fibrosis is confirmed.\n\nPatient's Mother:\n\nYes, the doctors mentioned congenital hepatic fibrosis as the diagnosis.\n\nDoctor:\n\nFor  treatment,  were  currently  prescribing  the  following  medications:  Inderal  10  mg  twice  a  day,\n\nOss-Pro syrup 5 ml once daily, Cefspan DS syrup 5 ml once daily, A Dew drops two drops daily, and\n\nIndrop D once every 15 days. I have also advised a liver biopsy and shearwave elastography in the\n\nplan. Additionally, well continue surveillance endoscopy and follow-up after three months.\n\nPatient's Mother:\n\nThank  you,  doctor.  We  will  follow  the  plan  as  suggested.  Is  there  anything  else  we  should  be\n\nconcerned about?\n\nDoctor:\n\nCurrently,  the  focus  is  on  managing  his  symptoms,  preventing  further  complications  like  variceal\n\nbleeding,  and  closely  monitoring  liver  function.  Well  continue  to  adjust  his  treatment  based  on  his\n\n\fresponse. Please also be mindful of his diet and the medications. Lets plan for a follow-up visit in\n\nthree months. If his condition worsens before then, dont hesitate to contact us sooner.\n\nPatient's Mother:\n\nThank  you  so  much  for  your  care,  doctor.  Well  make  sure  to  follow  up  regularly  and  keep  you\n\nupdated.\n\nFollow-Up Visit on 26th February 2024\n\nDoctor:\n\nHello, how has Jawad been doing since we last saw him?\n\nPatient's Mother:\n\nHes  been  having  some  issues  with  black,  tarry  stools  again,  and  weve  noticed  that  his  abdominal\n\ndistention persists. He has also been sleeping a lot and is still quite irritable.\n\nDoctor:\n\nLets review his recent tests. His latest endoscopy on 10th February 2024 showed grade 1 varices\n\nwith  gastroenteropathy.  He  had  a  follow-up  ultrasound  on  17th  March  2024,  which  showed  mild\n\nhepatomegaly  with  homogeneous  texture.  His  liver  enzymes  are  still  elevated,  and  his  albumin\n\nlevels remain low.\n\nPatient's Mother:\n\nYes,  weve  been  following  the  treatment  regimen,  and  his  symptoms  have  been  somewhat\n\nmanageable, but theres still a lot of concern.\n\nDoctor:\n\n\fWell  continue  with  the  treatment  plan  as  advised.  Theres  no  change  in  his  medications:  Inderal,\n\nOss-Pro,  and  other  treatments.  I  would  also  recommend  that  you  follow  up  with  a  specialist  for\n\nfurther  optimization  of  his  medical  care.  Well  keep  a  close  eye  on  his  liver  function  and  general\n\nwell-being.\n\nPatient's Mother:\n\nUnderstood, doctor. Well keep following up as instructed. Thank you for your ongoing support.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYoure  welcome.  Keep  a  close  watch  on  his  condition  and  reach  out  if  you  notice  any  significant\n\nchanges. See you in three months for the next follow-up.\n\nFinal Follow-Up on 12th June 2024\n\nDoctor:\n\nHello, how is Jawad doing today?\n\nPatient's Mother:\n\nHes  been  struggling  with  his  symptoms,  but  weve  kept  up  with  his  medications.  Hes  been  having\n\nmore frequent black stools, and his distended abdomen has caused more discomfort.\n\nDoctor:\n\nBased on his latest examination and lab results, weve confirmed that his liver is still showing signs\n\nof significant strain. The next step is to consider liver transplantation. Well need to work closely with\n\nspecialists  for  counseling  and  further  evaluations.  Lets  continue  the  current  medications  and  keep\n\nmanaging his symptoms as best as we can.\n\n\fPatient's Mother:\n\nWere ready to take any necessary steps. Thank you for your continued care.\n\nDoctor:\n\nWell continue to support you and Jawad through this. Lets keep a strong line of communication and\n\naddress any issues that arise.\n\n\f",

    "raw_text": "Gender: Male\n\nAge: 41\n\nMRN: 767766\n\nDiagnosis: Chronic viral hepatitis C\n\nHistory and Physical:\n\nPatient: Hi, Doctor, Im feeling a bit off today.\n\nDoctor: Hello! How are you feeling overall?\n\nPatient: Ive been having some epigastric discomfort and dizziness after meals.\n\nDoctor: Alright, lets go through your details. You had a liver transplant (SP LDLT) due to HCV, HCC,\n\nand DCLD, with the surgery on July 10th, 2024, and you were discharged on July 29th, 2024. You're\n\ncurrently on POD (post-operative day) 5 months.\n\nDoctor: I see your latest AFP (on November 4th, 2024) is 8.35, which is high. Let's take a look at\n\nyour CT scan from the same date.\n\nCT  Scan:  Transplanted  liver  shows  smooth  margins  with  normal  enhancement.  No  focal  lesion.\n\nPatent hepatic vasculature, including both hepatic arteries. Minimal intrahepatic biliary prominence\n\nis  unchanged.  The  large  air-containing  collection  has  almost  fully  resolved  with  a  small  residual\n\nvolume along the hepatic cut surface in the right sub-diaphragmatic region, measuring 2 x 5 x 1.2\n\ncm, corresponding to a volume of 6 ml. No other collection or significant findings. Splenomegaly of\n\n13.5 cm is noted without ascites or significant abdominal lymphadenopathy.\n\nDoctor:  Your  wound  looks  healthy  with  no  major  concerns.  Theres  no  active  issue  other  than  the\n\nepigastric discomfort after meals. Your medications and lab results are reviewed, and well continue\n\nwith the same doses for tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil.\n\n\fDoctor:  Id  recommend  a  follow-up  after  3  weeks.  Also,  please  keep  an  eye  on  your  diet,  and  feel\n\nfree to contact me if anything changes. If you experience any new symptoms or issues, let me know\n\nimmediately.\n\nPatient:  Ive  been  feeling  slightly  better  overall,  but  I  still  have  some  pain  at  the  surgical  site,\n\nespecially on the right hypochondrial area. Its been bothering me for the past week.\n\nDoctor: Noted. You were readmitted on August 22nd, 2024, for abdominal distention and pain. A CT\n\nscan  showed  a  large  collection  along  the  cut  surface,  extending  into  the  subhepatic  region  with  a\n\nvolume  of  about  512  ml.  An  IR-guided  percutaneous  catheter  was  inserted,  and  the  fluid  culture\n\ncame  back  positive  for  Klebsiella  pneumonia.  The  antibiotics  were  adjusted  accordingly.

A  diet  adjustment  could  help  improve  your  overall  condition.  Ill  also  review  your  CT\n\nscans regularly to check for any changes. Pain management can be managed with Panadol 500 mg\n\nas needed.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Doctor. Ill keep monitoring my condition and follow the treatment plan.\n\nDoctor: Great, please do, and make sure to follow up after 2 weeks for your next appointment.

What brings you to the hospital today?\n\nPatient: Good morning, doctor. I've been having pain in my right upper abdomen and jaundice. I've\n\nalso lost a lot of weight in the last three months.\n\nDoctor: I see. Can you describe the pain? When did it start?\n\nPatient: The pain started about three months ago. It was sudden and quite severe. Along with that, I\n\nnoticed my skin and eyes turning yellow.\n\nDoctor: Have you experienced any other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, or fever?\n\nPatient:  No,  just  the  pain,  jaundice,  and  weight  loss.  Ive  lost  around  20  kg  and  my  appetite  has\n\ndecreased significantly.\n\nDoctor:  Have  you  ever  had  any  liver-related  complications  before,  such  as  ascites,  variceal\n\nbleeding, or hepatic encephalopathy?\n\nPatient: No, doctor, nothing like that before.\n\nDoctor: Do you have any past medical or surgical history?\n\nPatient: No, I have never had any major illnesses or surgeries.\n\nDoctor: Are you taking any medications at home?\n\nPatient: No, but recently I started taking Paracetamol, Tamsulosin, Spironolactone, Furosemide, and\n\nPantoprazole.\n\nDoctor: Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any drugs?\n\nPatient: No, I dont drink or use drugs.\n\nDoctor: Are you married? What do you do for a living?\n\n\fPatient: Yes, I am married. I am retired now.\n\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing this information. Lets do a physical examination.\n\n(Physical Examination Performed)\n\n(cid:9)General Examination: No pallor, jaundice present, no edema.\n\n(cid:9)Gastrointestinal: Abdomen soft, non-tender, bowel sounds audible.\n\n(cid:9)Respiratory & CNS: Normal.\n\nDoctor:  Well  also  need  to  run  some  blood  tests  and  imaging  studies.

The jaundice has improved a little.\n\nDoctor:  Thats  good  to  hear.  Your  recent  CT  scan  shows  an  ill-defined  hypodense  mass  in  the\n\nampullary  region,  causing  bile  duct  dilatation.  We  suspect  a  periampullary  tumor.  We  need  to\n\nperform an ERCP with a biopsy to confirm.\n\nPatient: I understand. Will I need surgery?\n\nDoctor:  If  the  disease  is  localized  and  theres  no  metastasis,  surgery  might  be  possible.

You are a candidate for Whipples procedure.\n\nPatient: What is that?\n\nDoctor: Its a major surgical procedure where part of the pancreas, bile duct, and small intestine are\n\nremoved. Its the best treatment for your condition.\n\nPatients Son: What are the risks involved?\n\nDoctor: The mortality risk is around 4-5%, and theres a 10-15% chance of complications. However,\n\n\fthis is the only definitive treatment.\n\nPatient: I understand. Whats the next step?\n\nDoctor: We will discuss your case in our MDT meeting and then proceed with laparoscopic Whipples\n\nprocedure.

How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling okay, but I've been having some itching and dryness on my hands. The skin has\n\nbeen peeling for about three weeks now.\n\nDoctor: I see. Lets talk about your medical history and any issues youve been dealing with. Can you\n\nremind me when you first noticed the jaundice?\n\nPatient: I had abdominal distension back in 2019, which was associated with jaundice. After taking\n\ndiuretics, the ascites resolved. But then, a few months later, I developed ascites again, and they had\n\nto do a therapeutic tap. Ive also had multiple endoscopic proceduresabout 12 times.\n\nDoctor:  Thats  correct,  I  see.  And  how  have  you  been  managing  since  then?  Any  other  symptoms\n\nrecently?\n\nPatient:  I  haven't  felt  any  severe  pain  or  anything  like  that,  just  mild  headaches  and  weakness\n\nsometimes. Also, my skin has been itchy, and Ive been noticing some dryness and peeling on my\n\nhands.\n\nDoctor: Let's review the treatments we've been providing. Youve had a living donor liver transplant\n\n(LDLT)  on  July  3rd,  2024.  Youve  been  on  a  combination  of  medications,  including  Tacrolimus,\n\nRivaroxaban, and Mycophenolate. How is the surgical site healing?\n\n\fPatient: The scar looks healthy. There's no pain at the surgical site, and it seems to be healing well.\n\nDoctor: Thats good to hear. Well continue with the same medications for now. I see from the latest\n\nDoppler ultrasound on July 18th that there was minimal pleural effusion and mild ascites, which is\n\nbeing monitored closely. There was also a small fluid pocket in the left subdiaphragmatic region.\n\nPatient:  Yes,  I  noticed  some  fluid  accumulation  in  the  scan,  but  I  havent  felt  any  significant\n\ndiscomfort from it.\n\nDoctor: That's good. We will continue monitoring that. I noticed the Doppler showed some changes\n\nin  flow  as  well.  The  portal  vein  is  patent  with  antegrade  flow,  and  the  hepatic  veins  are  showing\n\ntriphasic flow, which is normal post-transplant.\n\nPatient: So, should I be concerned about the flow changes?\n\nDoctor: No, these are expected post-surgery and part of your recovery. The liver is adjusting well.\n\nWell continue to follow up with Doppler exams to keep an eye on these developments. Regarding\n\nyour  medications,  weve  increased  your  Tacrolimus  dose  slightly  and  changed  some  other\n\nmedications over time. You were advised not to ride motorbikes or attend school for a while, right?\n\nPatient: Yes, Ive been resting a lot, but Ive been worried about going back to school soon.\n\nDoctor: Given your recovery, were advising that you stay home for another month to rest fully and\n\navoid strain. Youve been prescribed Mycophenolate and Tacrolimus, and weve adjusted doses for\n\nbetter liver function.\n\n\fPatient: I understand. Ive also had some hair loss recently, which has been worrying me.\n\nDoctor: Hair loss can sometimes happen after surgery and with certain medications like Tacrolimus.\n\nIt  should  improve  over  time,  but  well  keep  monitoring  it.  Now,  as  for  the  skin  issuestheres  a\n\npossibility  that  you  have  scabies.  Were  going  to  prescribe  a  special  lotion  to  apply  overnight  for  a\n\nfew days.\n\nPatient: Oh, I didnt realize it might be scabies. How do I use the lotion?\n\nDoctor: Youll need to apply Lotrix Lotion (Permethrin 5%) to your body at night for three consecutive\n\ndays. This should help clear up the skin irritation.\n\nPatient: Okay, Ill follow those instructions.\n\nDoctor:  Great!  Well  continue  with  your  current  medications  and  labs.  Well  check  in  with  another\n\nDoppler abdomen ultrasound, CMV, and EBV PCR tests soon. Your next follow-up will be in about\n\nthree weeks.\n\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I feel more reassured now. Ill stick to the plan.\n\nDoctor:  You're  doing  well,  Laraib.  Stay  positive,  and  well  see  you  in  a  few  weeks  for  your  next\n\nfollow-up.\n\n\f",

How have you been feeling since our last visit?\n\nPatient:  The  abdominal  pain  has  improved  from  before.  Its  now  intermittent  and  mostly  in  the  left\n\nlumbar region. The pain occurs both before and after meals but resolves on its own.\n\nDoctor: That's good to hear. Have you experienced any other symptoms?\n\nPatient: Ive been sleeping a lot more than usual, but other than that, no major changes. My doctor\n\nhad stopped my warfarin about 1.5 months ago.

On your last visit, your bilirubin was at 1.3, ALT at 58, and AST at 42. Your INR was\n\nslightly elevated at 1.4, which we should keep an eye on. Your platelet count is within normal limits,\n\nthough, and your WBC count is 3.8. I see your protein C was low at 59% in May. Well monitor that.\n\nPatient: Yes, I remember those results.\n\nDoctor:  For  your  recent  ultrasound,  it  showed  a  mildly  enlarged  liver  with  a  heterogeneous\n\nechotexture  and  some  varices  in  the  hypertrophied  caudate  lobe.  There  was  also  an  echogenic\n\nchronic  thrombus  in  the  main  hepatic  veins,  which  is  consistent  with  the  sequelae  of  Budd-Chiari\n\nsyndrome. Your recent CT from June 7th also shows stenosis and occlusion at the confluence of the\n\nright, left, and middle hepatic veins with multiple intrahepatic collaterals draining into the infrahepatic\n\nIVC. You also have some background changes of chronic liver disease and splenomegaly.\n\nPatient: That sounds concerning. Is there anything new we should do?\n\nDoctor: Yes, the findings confirm that we need to continue with your liver disease workup. You are at\n\nstage F4 of fibrosis, as indicated by the shearwave elastography. Well continue monitoring closely.\n\nFor now, Id like to continue with your current medications and the follow-up plan.\n\nPatient: Okay, Doctor. Anything else I should know?\n\nDoctor:  We  are  also  planning  an  EGD  tomorrow  to  assess  any  varices  or  gastrointestinal\n\ninvolvement. During the procedure, we'll check the esophagus and band any varices if necessary.\n\n\fAdditionally, your blood work will include checking your protein C levels again, as well as screening\n\nfor celiac disease, given your family history. Well also recheck your ceruloplasmin and IgG levels, as\n\nwe need to rule out autoimmune causes.\n\nPatient: I understand. Is there anything else in the plan?\n\nDoctor: Yes, we will be doing a full baseline workup, including PELD/MELD scoring to evaluate your\n\nliver  function  and  potential  for  a  liver  transplant  in  the  future.  Ill  also  discuss  your  case  with  our\n\nmultidisciplinary  team  this  Friday.  Well  monitor  the  progression  closely,  and  I'll  make  sure  all  your\n\ntests and treatments are coordinated.\n\nPatient: Alright, Doctor. Thanks for explaining everything. Ill get ready for the EGD tomorrow.\n\nDoctor: Youre welcome, Husnain. Well make sure everything goes smoothly. See you tomorrow for\n\nthe procedure. Lets keep an eye on your condition and adjust as needed.\n\n\f",

Recently, I have also\n\nbeen having loose stools and noticed some rectal bleeding.\"\n\nDoctor:\n\n\"Thank  you  for  sharing  that.  I  understand  it  must  be  concerning.  When  did  these  symptoms  start,\n\nand do you have any history of similar issues?\"\n\nPatient:\n\n\"The pain started about a year ago when I was in the US. I have had loose stools along with rectal\n\nbleeding. Ive recently been diagnosed with HCV.\"\n\nDoctor:\n\n\"I see. Ill need to review your medical history and test results. Have you had any previous medical or\n\nsurgical issues?\"\n\nPatient:\n\n\"I had fits at a very young age, but there is no remarkable surgical history.\"\n\nDoctor:\n\n\"Thank  you  for  sharing  that.  Lets  check  your  current  condition.  Ill  go  over  your  vital  signs  and  lab\n\nresults. You mentioned you're taking no medications at the moment, correct?\"\n\n\fPatient:\n\n\"Yes, no medications currently.\"\n\nDoctor (Reviewing Examination and Lab Results):\n\n\"Your  weight  and  height  are  appropriate  for  your  age,  and  there's  no  sign  of  jaundice,  pallor,  or\n\nedema.  On  examination,  your  heart  and  lungs  are  normal,  and  your  gastrointestinal  exam  shows\n\nnormal bowel sounds. Let me review your lab results. Your bilirubin is normal at 0.4, but your ALT is\n\nelevated at 89, which is concerning. Your HCV PCR is quite high at 1,090,000 IU/mL.\"\n\nDoctor:\n\n\"It  looks  like  you  have  Hepatitis  C,  based  on  your  test  results.  I  recommend  starting  antiviral\n\ntreatment.  I'll  also  prepare  you  for  some  procedures.  We  will  proceed  with  an  EGD  and\n\ncolonoscopy, with specific preparations starting on the 16th of August. I will continue your treatment\n\nwith Sofosbuvir + Velpatasvir daily.\"\n\nPatient:\n\n\"What about my follow-up? When should I return to the clinic?\"\n\nDoctor:\n\n\"Your  follow-up  will  be  in  three  months.  Well  repeat  your  liver  function  tests  and  an  abdominal\n\nultrasound at that time. In the meantime, well follow the colonoscopy preparation instructions, which\n\ninclude  starting  a  soft  diet  on  the  16th  and  a  liquid-only  diet  by  the  19th.  Ill  also  prescribe  Movcol\n\nsachets for you to take in increasing doses starting from the 16th.\"\n\nPatient:\n\n\"Got it, Doctor. Ill follow those instructions. Whats next after the colonoscopy?\"\n\n\fDoctor:\n\n\"After the colonoscopy, well assess the findings. The biopsies from your duodenum, stomach, and\n\ncolon look mostly normal, but there are signs of mild gastritis and chronic active colitis in the colon,\n\nwhich we'll continue to monitor.\"\n\nPatient:\n\n\"Thanks for explaining everything. Ill see you in a few months.\"\n\n\f",

What brings you in today?\n\nPatient: I have been feeling nauseous lately.\n\nDoctor:  I  see.  Let  me  ask  you  a  few  questions.  Have  you  experienced  any  significant  weight  loss\n\nrecently?\n\nPatient: No, I havent had any weight loss.\n\nDoctor: Have you had any fevers or night sweats?\n\nPatient: No, no fevers or night sweats.\n\n\fDoctor: Any physical or cognitive limitations?\n\nPatient: No, I dont have any limitations.\n\nDoctor: Lets go over your investigations. You had an ultrasound, CT scan, and MRI. I see from the\n\nCT scan dated 15th February that it showed multiple bilobar hepatic lesions. Did you experience any\n\nsymptoms like jaundice or melena?\n\nPatient: No, I didnt have jaundice or melena.\n\nDoctor: I see your MRI from 6th March shows a large mass centered over segment 4 of 12cm with\n\nwashout  and  diffusion  restriction,  suggesting  HCC.  The  biopsy  shows  a  well-differentiated\n\nhepatocellular lesion, which favors hepatic adenoma.\n\nPatient: Yes, Ive been informed about the diagnosis of hepatic adenoma.\n\nDoctor:  Good.  We  are  discussing  surgery  options  for  you.  The  plan  is  to  perform  a  central\n\nhepatectomy  after  Eid.  I  would  like  to  submit  the  CDs  of  your  CT  scan  and  MRI  for  further  MDT\n\ndiscussion.\n\nPatient: Okay, I understand. I will send the CDs. Is there anything else I need to do?\n\nDoctor: You will meet Mr. Asif for surgery coordination, and we will perform a pre-operative workup.\n\nThe  risk  of  mortality  is  around  1-2%,  and  the  morbidity  risk  is  around  10%.  We  will  monitor  your\n\nprogress closely.\n\nFollow-Up Visit:\n\n\fDoctor: Welcome back, Sobia. How have you been feeling since your last visit?\n\nPatient: I dont have any active complaints. Everything feels normal.\n\nDoctor:  Great  to  hear.  I  see  that  your  CT  scan  from  PKLI,  dated  15th  February,  shows  multifocal\n\nbilobar  arterialized  lesions.  Though  the  biopsy  confirmed  hepatic  adenoma,  the  radiology  report\n\nsuggests that fibrolamellar HCC and fibro-nodular hyperplasia remain differential diagnoses.\n\nPatient: Yes, the doctors explained that.\n\nDoctor: For now, the MDT has advised surgery, as the liver mass could be related to either hepatic\n\nadenoma or fibro-nodular hyperplasia. We are proceeding with surgery after Eid.\n\nPatient: Got it. Is there any additional preparation I need to make?\n\nDoctor:  We  will  proceed  with  the  pre-operative  workup  and  fitness  tests.  Please  meet  the\n\ncoordinator,  Mr.  Asif,  for  further  details.  And  dont  forget,  the  risks  for  surgery  are  minimal,  but  it's\n\nimportant to be aware of the potential for complications.\n\nLab Results:\n\nHB: 14.4\n\nTLC: 10.6\n\nPLT: 349\n\n\fT-BIL: 0.7\n\nD-BIL: (Not recorded)\n\nALT/AST: 59/30\n\nALP: 239\n\nAlbumin: 4.8\n\nCreatinine: 0.51\n\nNa+: 139\n\nK+: 4.51\n\nINR: 1.03\n\nAssessment / Diagnosis:\n\nHepatic Adenoma\n\nPlan:\n\nCentral Hepatectomy after Eid\n\n\fSubmit CDs of CT and MRI for MDT discussion\n\nPre-operative workup and fitness check (Meet Mr. Asif)\n\nExplain risks of mortality (1-2%) and morbidity (10%)\n\n\f",

How can I assist you today?\n\nPatient:\n\nIve been having black stool for about a year now. It was intermittent, but for the past three months,\n\nits been continuous.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI see. Have you been hospitalized recently for this issue?\n\nPatient (Attendant):\n\nYes, she was admitted at Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology for deranged INR. She was referred to\n\nus for an evaluation regarding capsule endoscopy.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThank you for the information. Do you have any recent blood test reports?\n\nPatient (Attendant):\n\nHer hemoglobin is 6 according to us, but we don't have a recent report available.\n\nDoctor:\n\nUnderstood. Lets go over your medical history to get a better picture.\n\nDo you have any history of hypertension or other conditions?\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, I have hypertension. I also had hemorrhoids in the past.\n\nIn 2008, I underwent a dual valve replacement, and I was diagnosed with HCV in 2008, but I have\n\nnever received treatment for it.\n\n\fIve had episodes of decompensation, including the black stool and hepatic encephalopathy (PSE).\n\nDoctor:\n\nThank you for sharing that. Lets review your liver-related decompensation history:\n\n(cid:9)Ascites: Any swelling in the abdomen?\n\nPatient: No.\n\n(cid:9)Jaundice: Have you noticed yellowing of your skin or eyes?\n\nPatient: No.\n\n(cid:9)Variceal bleed: Any bleeding from the esophagus or stomach?\n\nPatient: Yes, I required multiple transfusions for variceal bleed.\n\n(cid:9)Hepatic encephalopathy: Have you experienced confusion or changes in mental status?\n\nPatient: Yes, Ive had hepatic encephalopathy before.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThank you for the details. Now, lets proceed with your past medical and surgical history.\n\nYou mentioned hypertension. Any other medical issues?\n\nPatient:\n\nOnly the history of HTN.\n\nDoctor:\n\nAny surgeries in the past?\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, I had a C-section 23 years ago, and I underwent DVR in 2008.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThank you for sharing. Are there any known allergies?\n\nPatient:\n\nNo allergies.\n\nDoctor:\n\nLets discuss your current medications. What are you taking at the moment?\n\nPatient (Attendant):\n\n\fShe is currently on the following medications:\n\n(cid:9)Aspirin 75mg once daily (stopped 1 year ago)\n\n(cid:9)Spiromide 40mg once daily\n\n(cid:9)Warfarin 13.75mg (one and a half tablets) once daily\n\n(cid:9)Digoxin 0.25mg once daily\n\n(cid:9)Syrup Ulsanic (two spoons twice daily)\n\nDoctor:\n\nGot it. Now, moving on to your psychosocial history. Are there any concerns about your lifestyle or\n\nlimitations?\n\nPatient:\n\nNo, no limitations, and no issues with language barriers.\n\nI am married but do not have an occupation.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThank you for clarifying. Any family history of significant illnesses?\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, my sister is diabetic.\n\nDoctor:\n\nNow, lets proceed with your physical examination.\n\nOn examination:\n\n(cid:9)You are an elderly female, appearing thin and frail.\n\n(cid:9)CNS: Your Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is 15/15, so no signs of acute neurological issues.\n\n(cid:9)GIT: Your abdomen is soft, and there is no tenderness.\n\nDoctor:\n\nWe also reviewed your recent investigations:\n\n(cid:9)EGD (Endoscopy): Three times, last on 6-12-24, with small erosions in the duodenal bulb.\n\n(cid:9)Ultrasound Abdomen (6-12-24): Coarse liver with splenomegaly.\n\nDoctor:\n\n\fHere are your lab results from 4-12-24:\n\n(cid:9)Hemoglobin: 9.3\n\n(cid:9)TLC: 6.3\n\n(cid:9)Platelets: 177\n\n(cid:9)Sodium: 104\n\n(cid:9)Potassium: 3.97\n\n(cid:9)Chloride: 75.5\n\n(cid:9)Total Bilirubin: 0.97\n\n(cid:9)Direct Bilirubin: 0.58\n\n(cid:9)ALT: 50.8\n\n(cid:9)ALP: 92.4\n\n(cid:9)AFP: 3.57\n\n(cid:9)INR: 2.17\n\nDoctor:\n\nYour  HCV  antibody  test  is  reactive.  Based  on  all  this  information,  I  believe  you  have  HCV-related\n\ndecompensated cirrhosis (DCLD), with ongoing issues of black stool and encephalopathy.\n\nYour hypertension is poorly controlled, and your dual valve replacement from 2008 is important to\n\nconsider in your treatment.\n\nDoctor:\n\nRegarding your medications, we will continue warfarin due to your DVR, but we need to adjust your\n\nanticoagulation therapy for your upcoming colonoscopy.\n\nPlan:\n\n(cid:9)Admit you for management of melena (black stool), low hemoglobin, and to arrange a colonoscopy.\n\n(cid:9)We will need to switch your anticoagulation therapy temporarily for the procedure.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI have also provided you with patient education on your condition.\n\n\fDiagnosis:\n\n(cid:9)HCV-related DCLD\n\n(cid:9)Decompensated with black stool and encephalopathy\n\n(cid:9)Hypertension (poorly controlled)\n\n(cid:9)Dual valve replacement (DVR) in 2008\n\n\f",

How are you today?\"\n\nPatient: \"I'm doing okay, but I've been dealing with some health issues lately.\"\n\nDoctor: \"I understand. I see you're a diabetic patient, and you also have HCV positive, right?\"\n\nPatient: \"Yes, I've been treated for HCV and have been through some medication.\"\n\nDoctor: \"And you've been experiencing some liver complications, like portal hypertension, and you\n\nhad an upper GI bleed and ascites. You also mentioned jaundice?\"\n\nPatient: \"Yes, Ive had all of that, and its been quite challenging.\"\n\nDoctor: \"Okay, based on this, the plan is to continue managing your condition with medications and\n\na referral to the OPD for further follow-up. You're currently on a good treatment plan.\"\n\n08/11/2024 - First Visit to Hepatology Clinic, Seen by Dr. Ammara Naveed\n\nDoctor: \"Welcome! What brings you in today?\"\n\nPatient:  \"I  came  in  because  I  had  an  upper  GI  bleed  earlier  this  year  in  February,  and  Id  like  to\n\ndiscuss a possible liver transplant.\"\n\nDoctor:  \"I  see  you  have  a  history  of  HCV  and  have  achieved  a  sustained  viral  response.  Im  also\n\nnoticing  that  youve  had  several  liver  decompensations,  like  ascites  and  jaundice,  and  a  history  of\n\nvariceal bleeding. How are you managing these symptoms?\"\n\nPatient: \"It's been tough. I had variceal bleeding in 2020, and again about six months ago. Ive also\n\nhad melena and multiple gastroscopies.\"\n\nDoctor: \"Okay, well plan for further diagnostic steps like gastroscopy and a CT scan to evaluate the\n\n\fextent of the damage. We need to review your diuretics, as you're not fully optimized on them yet. I\n\nalso  suggest  continuing  your  current  medications  and  adding  a  few  more,  including  lactulose  for\n\nconstipation.\"\n\nPatient: \"Got it, Ill follow through with the medications and tests.\"\n\n12/11/2024 - Follow-up Visit\n\nDoctor: \"How have you been since our last visit?\"\n\nPatient: \"Ive been feeling quite weak and noticed some abdominal distension.\"\n\nDoctor:  \"I  see.  Lets  review  your  situation.  Youre  still  dealing  with  ascites,  jaundice,  and  previous\n\nvariceal bleeds, correct?\"\n\nPatient: \"Yes, thats all still there.\"\n\nDoctor: \"Your CT scan confirms that the HCC lesions are present, with one of them measuring 1.8\n\ncm.  Based  on  this,  the  plan  remains  to  monitor  your  condition  and  consider  a  liver  transplant.  We\n\nwill also optimize your diuretic dosage and continue your medications.\"\n\nPatient: \"That makes sense. Whats the next step?\"\n\nDoctor: \"Well start you on more intensive monitoring, and Ill refer you to a hepatobiliary specialist for\n\na liver transplant evaluation. We also need to check your blood counts and liver function regularly.\"\n\n22/11/2024 - Emergency Care for Variceal Bleed\n\nDoctor: \"Youve come in for surveillance EGD today. How are you feeling?\"\n\nPatient: \"Ive had some bleeding from my varices again, though it seems to be under control.\"\n\nDoctor: \"Yes, the EGD shows altered blood and some oozing from the fundal varix. Weve injected\n\nhistoacryl, and there are no immediate complications. Im admitting you for monitoring and will start\n\nterlipressin and IV fluids. We might also need a blood transfusion.\"\n\nPatient: \"I understand. Ill stay here for observation.\"\n\n03/12/2024 - Liver Transplant Referral\n\n\fDoctor: \"Youre being referred for liver transplant consideration. How are you feeling about this?\"\n\nPatient: \"Its overwhelming, but I know its necessary.\"\n\nDoctor:  \"Your  current  labs  show  that  your  liver  disease  has  progressed,  and  the  HCC  is  still  a\n\nconcern. With your MELD score at 24, we need to move forward with the transplant process. Well\n\ncontinue  managing  your  symptoms  with  lactulose  and  other  medications.  Also,  well  monitor  your\n\nliver function and blood counts.\"\n\nPatient: \"Im ready for the transplant process, just worried about the donors health.\"\n\nDoctor: \"Weve explained the risks and benefits to both you and your family. The next steps include a\n\nfull review and counseling session. Well also discuss donor options.\"\n\n20/12/2024 - Psychiatry Notes\n\nDoctor:  \"How  are  you  coping  with  everything?  Youre  a  potential  liver  transplant  candidate,  and  I\n\nwanted to check in on your mental health.\"\n\nPatient: \"Ive been feeling a bit down, but overall, Im managing.\"\n\nDoctor: \"I see that you have mild depressive symptoms but no major psychiatric concerns. It's good\n\nthat you have family support, and youre aware of the risks and process involved in the transplant.\n\nWeve discussed everything, and youre clear on what to expect.\"\n\nPatient: \"Yes, Im aware. Ill stay in touch with my family for support.\"\n\n30/12/2024 - Follow-up with PSB, Dr. Ahmad Karim\n\nDoctor:  \"It  looks  like  your  workup  for  liver  transplant  is  progressing  well.  Youve  had  consultations\n\nwith psychiatry, cardiac, and pulmonary teams, all of which came back favorable.\"\n\nPatient:  \"Im  glad  everything  is  going  smoothly.  I  still  have  some  weakness,  and  Ive  been  dealing\n\nwith hard stools.\"\n\nDoctor: \"Well increase your lactulose dose to help with constipation and recheck your renal function,\n\nelectrolytes, and CBC. After that, we can continue monitoring you for transplant readiness.\"\n\nPatient: \"Thanks, Ill follow the plan and keep in touch with the team.\"\n\n\f30/12/2024 - Gynecology Consultation\n\nDoctor: \"Youve been referred for a gynecology consultation as part of your liver transplant workup.\n\nHow are you feeling today?\"\n\nPatient: \"Im okay. Ive had some pelvic issues, but nothing major.\"\n\nDoctor: \"Your ultrasound came back with no major findings. We'll repeat the pelvic ultrasound and\n\ndo a pap smear when the kit is available.\"\n\nPatient: \"Alright, I'll wait for the next steps.\"\n\n\f",

    "raw_text": "Gender: Female\n\nAge: 5\n\nMRN: 709356\n\nDiagnosis: Budd-Chiari syndrome\n\nHistory and Physical:\n\nPatient:  Doctor,  my  daughter  has  been  suffering  from  abdominal  distension,  jaundice,  fever,  and\n\ndecreased urine output for the last month.\n\nDoctor:  I  see,  thank  you  for  the  details.  Lets  go  over  some  information.  Based  on  the  lab  results\n\nfrom  September  2022,  I  can  see  a  few  concerning  findings.  Her  GGT  was  54,  albumin  was  3.2,\n\nbilirubin was elevated at 2.4, and ALT was 485. These could be indicative of liver dysfunction. Her\n\nliver enzymesAST, ALT, and ALPare also elevated, which suggests that the liver is under stress.\n\nPatient:  Yes,  shes  been  feeling  unwell  and  has  had  a  lot  of  discomfort.  What  else  did  the  tests\n\nshow?\n\nDoctor:  Her  white  blood  cell  count  was  14.1,  which  could  indicate  an  ongoing  infection.  The\n\nhemoglobin is 7.7, which is low, indicating that she is anemic. Also, the INR is 1.3, which suggests a\n\nslight clotting issue. Hepatitis A and C tests were negative, which is good, but her liver function is\n\nstill a concern.\n\nPatient: Shes been on some medications, but it doesnt seem like theyve helped much.\n\nDoctor:  I  see  that  shes  currently  taking  Aldactone  and  Lasoride.  These  medications  help  manage\n\nfluid  retention  and  high  blood  pressure  but  might  not  be  addressing  the  underlying  cause  of  her\n\ncondition.  The  ultrasound  done  in  September  showed  a  possible  diagnosis  of  veno-occlusive\n\nsyndrome,  and  the  CT  scan  further  confirmed  a  Budd-Chiari  syndrome  picture,  which  involves\n\n\fhepatic vein obstruction.\n\nPatient: Oh, I see. What does that mean for her?\n\nDoctor: Budd-Chiari syndrome is a serious condition where the blood flow out of the liver is blocked.\n\nThis  causes  pressure  to  build  up  in  the  liver,  leading  to  symptoms  like  ascites,  jaundice,  and  an\n\nenlarged  liver.  The  treatment  usually  involves  addressing  the  liver's  function  and  preventing\n\ncomplications.\n\nPatient: Whats the next step for her?\n\nDoctor: Were planning a virtual clinic tomorrow for further monitoring and would like you to submit\n\nthe  CT  scan  CD  for  review.  Well  also  continue  her  medications  as  discussed.  She  needs  a  liver\n\nbiopsy and further workup, including an EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) to check for varices.\n\nFollow-up on 10-11-2022:\n\nPatient:  Doctor,  I  brought  my  daughter  in  for  a  follow-up.  Shes  still  dealing  with  abdominal\n\ndistension.\n\nDoctor: Thank you for bringing her in. I reviewed her records, and based on her ultrasound, she still\n\nhas  hepatomegaly  (enlarged  liver)  and  a  non-homogenous  liver  texture.  Her  condition  has  been\n\ndiagnosed as Budd-Chiari syndrome. We will continue her current medications, including Aldactone\n\nand Ibert syrup.\n\nPatient: Shes also been having trouble with her breathing and cough. Does that have anything to do\n\nwith her condition?\n\n\fDoctor: Yes, the cough could be a sign of fluid buildup in her lungs due to liver dysfunction. Her liver\n\nenlargement is causing pressure, which can lead to fluid accumulating in her abdomen and lungs.\n\nPatient: Whats the plan moving forward?\n\nDoctor: We will need to test for Hepatitis E and A again, and run additional tests like CBC, LFT, and\n\nRFT to monitor her liver and kidney function. Also, were considering giving her vitamin K injections\n\nonce  a  week.  Ill  also  recommend  a  course  of  Vermox  syrup  for  three  days  and  will  continue  her\n\ncurrent medications. A follow-up in a month is necessary to assess her progress.\n\nFollow-up on 19-01-2023:\n\nPatient: Doctor, shes still having issues with her abdominal distension. Its been two months now.\n\nDoctor: Ive reviewed her latest lab results from December 2022. Her bilirubin level is now 1.5, which\n\nis better, but still elevated. Her liver enzymes (ALT, AST) have decreased, which is a positive sign.\n\nHowever, her INR has risen to 1.8, so we need to be cautious about bleeding.\n\nPatient: Should we change her medications?\n\nDoctor:  No  major  changes  to  her  current  regimen  yet,  but  well  increase  the  vitamin  K  to  twice\n\nweekly,  and  shell  continue  with  Maltofer  syrup  for  iron  supplementation.  We  will  also  start  her  on\n\nInderal for blood pressure management and Lopin EC to help with the liver condition.\n\nFollow-up on 18-09-2024:\n\n\fPatient:  Doctor,  shes  been  having  some  new  symptoms.  Shes  been  vomiting  blood  in  the  last  24\n\nhours, and her abdomen is distended.\n\nDoctor:  This  is  concerning.  I  see  that  her  ascites  has  worsened,  and  she  has  developed  Grade  I\n\nencephalopathy, which could indicate worsening liver function. Her labs show a drop in hemoglobin\n\nto  10.3,  which  means  shes  losing  blood.  Her  platelets  are  low,  which  can  also  be  a  sign  of  liver\n\ndysfunction.  The  CT  scan  from  earlier  this  year  still  shows  hepatomegaly  and  obliterated  hepatic\n\nveins.\n\nPatient: Whats the next step? What do we need to do?\n\nDoctor:  We  need  to  admit  her  for  urgent  care,  especially  with  her  encephalopathy  and  bleeding\n\nepisodes.  A  liver  transplant  remains  the  definitive  treatment  for  her,  but  we  need  to  optimize  her\n\ncondition first. Ill refer her to a specialized children's hospital for further management.\n\nPatient: What else can we do in the meantime?\n\nDoctor:  Continue  the  current  medicationsSpironolactone,  Furosemide,  Vitamin  K,  and  others.  But\n\nthe main priority is to stabilize her condition, and once shes medically optimized, well proceed with\n\nthe transplant discussion.\n\nFollow-up on 18-11-2024:\n\nPatient: Shes still dealing with some of the same symptoms, like ascites, jaundice, and edema.\n\nDoctor:  Yes,  its  been  a  challenging  time  for  her.  The  EGD  results  show  Grade  IV  varices,  which\n\nmeans theres a high risk of bleeding. Weve started her on a beta-blocker (Propranolol) to manage\n\n\fher portal hypertension and control bleeding risks. Her ascites has worsened, and were continuing\n\nher treatment with Spironolactone and Lasoride.\n\nPatient: Is there anything else we should consider?\n\nDoctor:  Well  continue  with  Vitamin  K  every  15  days,  and  Ive  also  prescribed  Propanolol  and  Ora\n\ndrops to manage her liver condition. As always, we need to keep monitoring her closely for any new\n\nsymptoms or complications.\n\nPatient: How long until shes stable enough for a transplant?\n\nDoctor: Well need to focus on stabilizing her condition with medical management. Once we get the\n\nresults  of  the  financial  screening  and  optimization,  we  can  begin  the  discussion  about  the  liver\n\ntransplant.\n\nPlan:\n\nContinue monitoring liver function and manage complications\n\nLiver transplant remains the long-term goal\n\nFollow-up after financial screening\n\n\f",

This is my first visit here.\n\nDoctor: Welcome. Let's go over your medical history. Do you have any comorbidities?\n\nPatient:  Yes,  I  have  diabetes  mellitus.  Im  on  insulin,  26  units  in  the  morning.  I  used  to  smoke  but\n\nquit 4 months ago. I don't drink alcohol, and I havent taken any hakeem medications.\n\nDoctor: Alright. Have you had any treatments for Hepatitis C?\n\nPatient:  Yes,  I  was  treated  twice.  The  first  time  was  with  interferons  for  6  months,  about  15  years\n\nago. The second time, I was treated with DAAs for 6 months, 7-8 years ago. Both times, I achieved\n\nsustained virological response (SVR).\n\nDoctor: Great to hear. Have you had any liver-related issues?\n\nPatient:  Yes,  I  have  chronic  liver  disease  (DCLD)  and  Ive  had  hematemesis  (last  episode  7  years\n\nago), melena (last episode years ago), ascites, and jaundice.\n\nDoctor: Understood. Lets review your recent tests. You had a USG Abdomen in December 2023. It\n\nshowed  coarse  liver  with  splenomegaly,  multiple  dilated  veins  at  the  splenic  hilum,  moderate\n\nascites, and thick gallbladder sludge with wall edema. How are you feeling?\n\n\fPatient: Ive been having RUQ pain, weakness, yellowing of my eyes, and some weight loss.\n\nDoctor: Okay. Your liver function tests (LFTs) in December 2023 showed a total bilirubin of 2.9, ALT\n\nof  110,  AST  of  83,  and  ALP  of  252.  Creatinine  was  0.9.  Your  last  CT  triphasic  HCC  protocol  in\n\nNovember 2023 showed cirrhotic liver, no arterialized lesions, moderate ascites, and multiple upper\n\nabdominal collateral formations.\n\nPatient: That sounds serious.\n\nDoctor:  It's  important  we  keep  an  eye  on  these  things.  For  now,  we'll  continue  with  your  current\n\nmedications and follow up in 2 weeks. Also, I advise you to eat smaller, more frequent meals.\n\nPatient Visit: 13 March 2024\n\nPatient: Ive been experiencing some pain in my abdomen.\n\nDoctor: Based on your symptoms and a recent CT scan, weve identified a CBD stone. We need to\n\nrefer you for an ERCP procedure to address this.\n\nFollow-Up Visit: 5 April 2024\n\nPatient: How is my condition now, Doctor?\n\nDoctor: Youre showing improvements. Your liver function tests (LFTs) are better, and your bilirubin\n\nlevels  are  trending  down.  Your  diagnosis  is  still  HCV-related  DCLD  with  ascites,  and  you  had  the\n\nobstructive  jaundice  due  to  the  choledocholithiasis.  The  stone  was  successfully  removed  through\n\nthe ERCP.\n\n\fPatient: Thats a relief. Whats next?\n\nDoctor: Well stop the B-blocker due to your low blood pressure and stop the painkillers. I want you\n\nto have LFTs every two weeks. Well follow up in 6 weeks to monitor your progress.\n\nFollow-Up Visit: 3 June 2024\n\nPatient: Doctor, Ive been feeling weak and lethargic.\n\nDoctor:  Based  on  your  recent  CT  scan  from  March  2024,  theres  no  sign  of  HCC,  but  were  still\n\nmanaging your chronic liver disease. We identified a large calculus in the distal end of the CBD. The\n\nERCP was successful in removing it.\n\nPatient: Ive been on Spiromide, but Im still feeling tired.\n\nDoctor: Given your symptoms, well stop Spiromide and start Lasix instead. Your recent lab results\n\nshow  some  improvement,  but  your  albumin  is  low  at  2.2.  We'll  repeat  your  LFTs  and  do  an  USG\n\nabdomen. Youll need a follow-up in 3 months.\n\n\f",

How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Ive been feeling quite weak and dizzy, and Ive had some nausea.\n\nDoctor: Can you tell me more about your history? Have you had any bleeding or other issues?\n\nPatient:  Yes,  Ive  had  some  bleeding  per  rectum  due  to  hemorrhoids,  but  thats  been  an  ongoing\n\nissue related to constipation.\n\nDoctor: I see. Let me check your vitals. You seem stable for now. Your weight is 68 kg, and your\n\nabdomen is soft, non-tender with an umbilical hernia.\n\nPatient: Im concerned about my liver condition. Ive had ascites for the past month.\n\nDoctor: I understand. Your last liver function tests were done on 14th February. Let me go over the\n\nresults:\n\nHemoglobin: 9\n\nPlatelets: 71,000\n\nALT: 29, AST: 42\n\n\fBilirubin: 2.28\n\nAlbumin: 1.9\n\nCreatinine: 0.7\n\nSodium: 139\n\nPotassium: 4\n\nAFP: 8.17\n\nPatient: What does this mean for my treatment?\n\nDoctor:  Based  on  these  results,  your  liver  is  showing  signs  of  cirrhosis  and  ascites.  Weve  started\n\nyou  on  Velpaget  for  your  HCV  relapse,  and  well  monitor  your  progress  closely.  I  also  recommend\n\nsome medications for symptom management like spironolactone and omeprazole.\n\nPatient: Im on spironolactone, but Im worried about the side effects.\n\nDoctor: We will adjust your medications if needed. Youre also scheduled for some follow-up tests to\n\nassess liver function further, and well consider liver transplant options.\n\nDate: 03/03/23\n\nDoctor: Lets go over your CT scan results. The CT shows a single 1.1 cm HCC in segment VI, but\n\nno tumor thrombosis. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Im feeling a bit better, but Im still weak. The dizziness persists.\n\nDoctor:  Understood.  The  good  news  is  that  your  liver  has  some  cirrhotic  changes,  but  we  will\n\n\fcontinue  managing  your  ascites  with  diuretics.  Weve  already  discussed  potential  liver  transplant\n\noptions with your daughter, though her BMI is a bit high.\n\nPatient: Yes, shes willing to be the donor.\n\nDoctor:  Thats  great  to  hear.  Well  proceed  with  testing  her  blood  group  and  make  sure  shes  a\n\nsuitable donor. For now, lets continue your medications and manage your symptoms.\n\nDate: 03/04/23\n\nDoctor: How are you feeling today, Rehana?\n\nPatient: Im still feeling weak, but theres no new pain or discomfort.\n\nDoctor: Lets review your recent lab results:\n\nUrea: 28\n\nCreatinine: 0.9\n\nSodium: 122\n\nPotassium: 5.6\n\nTotal Bilirubin: 1.7\n\nPatient: My abdomen feels okay today. No signs of ascites.\n\nDoctor:  Thats  good  to  hear.  Weve  scheduled  a  follow-up  in  two  weeks,  but  well  continue  your\n\nmedications for now. Lets also check on your hemorrhoids and consider a referral to a GI surgeon\n\nfor further treatment.\n\n\fDate: 18/04/23\n\nDoctor:  Rehana,  your  recent  test  results  show  that  the  liver  transplant  is  the  best  option  for  you.\n\nYour daughter is still interested in being a donor, although she has a BMI of 30.3.\n\nPatient: Yes, shes willing, but Im a bit worried about the BMI issue.\n\nDoctor:  Well  take  care  of  that.  Weve  also  referred  you  to  Dr.  Tauseef  for  the  next  steps  in  the\n\ntransplant process. The good news is your HCV has been under control. Youve been on DAAs, and\n\nwell continue the process based on your test results.\n\nDate: 23/05/23\n\nDoctor: Lets look at your recent results. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: I feel a bit better, though still weak.\n\nDoctor: The last EGD was done on 12/05 due to some melena, and it showed gastric erosions.\n\nPatient: Ive had some abdominal discomfort.\n\nDoctor:  Well  adjust  your  medications  accordingly.  Youll  continue  on  Movicol,  Surbex-Z,  and  other\n\nsupportive meds. Lets plan to repeat the CT scan and AFP in three months.\n\nDate: 30/05/23\n\nDoctor: How are you feeling today, Rehana?\n\nPatient: I still feel some general weakness, and I have some discomfort in my abdomen.\n\nDoctor: On examination, your abdomen is soft, non-tender, and not distended. Your liver condition\n\nseems stable. Youve had mild ascites, but theres no need for tapping. I recommend continuing with\n\nspironolactone, Movicol, and Surbex-Z. Well follow up in four weeks.\n\nDate: 05/06/23\n\n\fDoctor: Lets discuss the next steps for your liver transplant. Your recent medical check-up is clear,\n\nand your workup is complete. Your daughter remains a potential donor, but we will need to evaluate\n\nher BMI further.\n\nPatient: Yes, I understand. Im ready for the transplant process to move forward.\n\nDoctor:  Well  continue  with  the  current  management  plan  and  schedule  a  follow-up  for  your\n\ntransplant date after your daughters exams.\n\nDate: 26/07/23\n\nDoctor: Rehana, its great to see you post-transplant. How have you been feeling?\n\nPatient: Ive been feeling okay, but Im having shortness of breath and difficulty swallowing solid food.\n\nDoctor: Well adjust your medications accordingly. Your liver biopsy shows no vascular invasion, and\n\nyour transplant seems to be progressing well.

However, I haven't achieved SVR.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI  see.  You  dont  have  diabetes  or  hypertension,  but  you  do  have  decompensated  cirrhosis  with\n\nascites, portal-systemic encephalopathy (PSE), and jaundice. Well need to monitor and manage this\n\nclosely.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYou are classified as Child-Pugh Class C (10). Unfortunately, a donor is not available yet, so we'll\n\ncontinue with your treatment for acute kidney injury (AKI) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).\n\nPlan:\n\nSend Child-Pugh score labs\n\nAFP test\n\nMRI liver dynamic when creatinine is < 2.0\n\n\fContinue medical optimization at Shalimar Hospital\n\nThe family was informed about the need for a liver transplant after medical optimization and ECOG\n\nimprovement.\n\nThe patient will come tomorrow with a donor.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI'll be following up on this, and well discuss the transplant process more when we see the donor.\n\n23-08-2024: Initial Nephrology Visit\n\nPatient:\n\nDoctor, I came today for your opinion on the triphasic CT scan. My creatinine is 1.8.\n\nDoctor:\n\nIt looks like we can proceed with the CT scan, but youll need IV hydration first. You should get 100\n\nml normal saline in one hour before the contrast, followed by 100 ml per hour for the next 4 hours.\n\nDoctor:\n\nAfter the CT, well repeat your creatinine levels in 3 days.\n\n03-09-2024: HPB & LTX Clinic\n\nPatient:\n\nDoctor, I've been having abdominal distension and orthopnea. Ive had these symptoms for a while\n\nnow.\n\n\fDoctor:\n\nI see, you were diagnosed with HCV in 2006 and treated with DAAs for 6 months. You've achieved\n\nSVR. From July 2024, your ascites became diuretic-resistant, and you had an ascitic tap for relief.\n\nNow you're seeking a liver transplant opinion.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYouve  had  two  episodes  of  portal-systemic  encephalopathy  (PSE)  and  no  significant  jaundice  or\n\nhematemesis. Your last ascitic tap was on 02-09-2024, and we took 2L of fluid.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYouve also had significant weight loss, but no blood transfusions, fever, or night sweats.\n\nReview of Medical History:\n\nHypertension\n\nNo prior surgeries\n\nOn current medications including rifaxamine, aminoliban powder, lactulose syrup, and carvedilol.\n\nThe family history includes diabetes in your older brother and hypertension in your younger brother.\n\nExamination:\n\nConscious, well-oriented, GCS 15/15.\n\n\fAbdomen: Soft, non-tender, distended.\n\nInvestigations:\n\nUltrasound (26-06-24): Chronic liver changes, splenomegaly, severe ascites, cholelithiasis.\n\nCT Scan (26-08-24): No HCC, moderate ascites, pleural effusion, and concerns about lung infection.\n\nLabs:\n\nHb: 8.8\n\nCreatinine: 1.7\n\nAlbumin: 2.14\n\nCTP: 10C\n\nMELD Na: 18\n\nDiagnosis:\n\nHCV-related decompensated liver disease.\n\nLiver transplant is the definitive treatment option.\n\nDiscussed  donor  criteria  and  associated  risks  including  mortality,  morbidity,  and  post-transplant\n\n\fcomplications.\n\nPlan:\n\nContinue medications and optimize the patient for transplant.\n\nFamily was informed about the risks of living donor liver transplant, including potential complications\n\nand the need for lifelong immunosuppressants.\n\n26-09-2024: Gynaecology Clinic\n\nPatient:\n\nIm here for a follow-up regarding my liver transplant candidacy.\n\nDoctor:\n\nWe  reviewed  your  medical  history.  Youre  post-menopausal,  and  your  ultrasound  shows  no\n\nsignificant pelvic pathology.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYour liver transplant candidacy is still under review, and were considering your cardiovascular status\n\nas well.\n\n03-10-2024: Right Heart Catheterization\n\nPatient:\n\nI had the heart catheterization today. What are the results?\n\n\fDoctor:\n\nThe catheterization and coronary angiogram came back normal. Youre at low risk for major adverse\n\ncardiovascular  events  during  elective  non-cardiac  surgery,  so  were  clear  to  proceed  with  liver\n\ntransplant surgery after optimizing your thyroid levels.\n\nPlan:\n\nContinue with the liver transplant evaluation and treatment optimization.\n\n15-10-2024: Follow-up Visit\n\nPatient:\n\nIve been testing positive for COVID-19, so my liver transplant evaluation was delayed.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYes, weve postponed your transplant evaluation for now. Your workup is completed, but well need\n\nto re-evaluate your condition once your COVID status clears.\n\nPlan:\n\nContinue monitoring your symptoms and complete your evaluation once youre cleared.\n\n\f",

It's causing a lot of discomfort.\n\nDoctor: I see. Can you tell me a bit more about how long you've been experiencing this issue?\n\nPatient: It started around 3 years ago, along with a fever. At first, I was treated for abdominal TB at a\n\nlocal  hospital  for  about  a  year.  After  that,  I  was  okay  for  two  years,  but  then  the  same\n\nsymptomsfever  and  abdominal  distentioncame  back.  I  saw  Dr.  Nagina  Shahzadi  who  gave  me\n\nantibiotics, but things didnt improve much, so I was referred to Childrens Hospital Lahore for further\n\ntreatment.\n\nDoctor: And what happened at Childrens Hospital?\n\nPatient: I was admitted for about 15 days, and after several investigations, they diagnosed me with\n\nBudd  Chiari  Syndrome  based  on  a  CT  scan  and  ultrasound  of  my  abdomen.  They  also  had  to  do\n\nmultiple taps during my stay.\n\nDoctor: Got it. Have you experienced any decompensations since then?\n\nPatient: Yes, Ive had jaundice and ascites.\n\nDoctor:  I  understand.  Let  me  check  your  previous  medical  history...  You  mentioned  a  history  of\n\nabdominal TB. Can you tell me more about that?\n\n\fPatient: I had treatment for abdominal TB for a year in Aziz Fatima Hospital. After that, I was stable\n\nfor about two years before the symptoms returned.\n\nDoctor: Okay, thank you for that information. Let me now check your current examination findings.\n\nYouve been showing signs of jaundice, pallor, and edema up to your ankles, correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, thats right. Ive also had some difficulty breathing and Ive been feeling really tired.\n\nDoctor: I see that your physical exam shows hepatomegaly, prominent veins, and mild to moderate\n\nascites. Well need to closely monitor your liver function and ascites management.\n\nPatient:  Ive  been  following  my  medications,  as  advised.  Im  currently  on  Syrup  Paracetamol,\n\nLasoride, Aldactone, and a few others. Is this still the right treatment for me?\n\nDoctor: Yes, your current medications seem appropriate for managing the condition. However, well\n\nneed to make some adjustments based on the latest lab results and radiological findings. Let me go\n\nover those with you.\n\nDoctor: Your recent lab results show that your bilirubin is 2.3, AST is 125, albumin is low at 2.2, and\n\nyour INR is elevated at 2.2. These all suggest liver dysfunction, and we need to continue managing\n\nthose with medications like albumin replacement. Your hemoglobin is also quite low at 8.4, and your\n\nplatelet count is 78, so we need to monitor for any bleeding risks.\n\nPatient: I see. Is there anything else I need to be concerned about?\n\nDoctor: Your livers condition is quite concerning, and I also want to highlight the findings from your\n\n\frecent radiological scans. Your ultrasound shows liver enlargement with hypertrophy of the caudate\n\nlobe.  The  CT  scan  shows  signs  of  hepatomegaly,  with  a  narrowed  intrahepatic  IVC  and  features\n\nconsistent with Budd Chiari Syndrome.\n\nPatient: Whats the plan moving forward?\n\nDoctor:  Well  continue  your  medications,  but  we  are  considering  a  liver  transplant  as  the  definitive\n\ntreatment.  Well  discuss  this  in  our  multidisciplinary  team  (MDT)  meeting.  In  the  meantime,  well\n\ndiscontinue the diuretics, monitor your lab results closely, and plan for an endoscopy to assess any\n\nother potential issues.\n\nPatient: That sounds serious. What do I need to do at home?\n\nDoctor:  Youll  need  to  continue  your  current  medications  and  make  sure  you  follow  up  with  the\n\nscheduled labs. We also recommend some additional support, such as taking Vitamin A, D, and E\n\ndrops,  and  ensuring  you're  on  the  MCT  oil  regimen.  Ill  also  prescribe  some  antibiotics  in  case  of\n\ninfection.\n\nPatient: Thank you for explaining everything, doctor. Im a bit worried, but Ill follow your instructions\n\nclosely.\n\nDoctor: I understand this is a lot to take in. We will be here every step of the way, and well ensure\n\nyou get the best care possible. Lets stay in touch and monitor your progress closely. Do you have\n\nany other questions or concerns?\n\nPatient: Not at the moment. Ill follow up as you suggested. Thank you.\n\n\fImpression: Budd Chiari Syndrome\n\nPlan:\n\nDiscuss in MDT\n\nDiscontinue diuretics (Tablet Lasoride, Aldactone)\n\nFollow up on Friday\n\nRepeat baseline labs on follow-up\n\nScreening endoscopy planned\n\nContinue current medications\n\nParental counseling done\n\n\f",

I've been feeling okay, but I wanted to discuss my recent tests and\n\ntreatments.\n\nDoctor:  Good  morning!  Sure,  let's  go  over  your  recent  medical  history  and  test  results.  Youre  59\n\nyears  old,  and  weve  been  managing  your  condition  for  some  time  now.  You  were  diagnosed  with\n\nHepatitis C (HCV) back in 2020. You were treated with DAAs for three months, and your last HCV\n\nPCR test on 1st August 2024 came back as 'Not detected.'\n\nPatient:  Yes,  that's  right.  I  feel  fine  now,  but  I  had  a  pretty  rough  time  with  hematemesis  back  in\n\nMarch 2024.\n\nDoctor:  Yes,  I  remember.  You  had  an  episode  of  hematemesis  in  March  2024.  Fortunately,  you\n\nhavent  had  any  significant  decompensations  like  jaundice,  ascites,  or  encephalopathy  since  then.\n\nYour weight loss of 6kg over the last 6 months is a concern, though.\n\nPatient:  I  did  lose  some  weight.  Honestly,  I  didnt  think  much  of  it  at  first,  but  now  I  realize  its\n\nsomething I need to pay attention to. Also, I had 4 pints of RBCs transfused due to low blood levels.\n\nDoctor:  Right,  I  see.  You  havent  had  any  fevers  or  night  sweats,  so  thats  good.  Youre  currently\n\ntaking Carveda, Osonate, and Fefol. These medications are part of your ongoing management.\n\nPatient: Yes, those are my medications. No allergies, and I havent had any prior significant medical\n\n\for surgical issues besides cataract surgeries in 2020 and July 2024.\n\nDoctor: Understood. You also mentioned that youve been a former smoker, quitting 6 months ago.\n\nThats  good  progress.  Regarding  your  family  history,  your  father  had  diabetes,  but  no  other  major\n\nconditions, correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, thats right.\n\nDoctor:  Let's  go  over  your  systemic  examination  findings.  You  are  conscious,  well-oriented,  and\n\nyour Glasgow Coma Scale is 15/15. Your cardiovascular and gastrointestinal exams are normal with\n\nno tenderness in the abdomen.\n\nPatient: That's a relief.\n\nDoctor:  Now,  about  your  investigations:  Your  last  OGD  with  EVBL  was  done  in  March,  where  we\n\nfound F3 esophageal varices. The CT scan from July showed a small lesion of 2x2.5 cm in segment\n\n6 of your liver, along with multiple nodes at the porta hepatis.\n\nPatient: So, the lesion is still a concern?\n\nDoctor:  Yes,  the  lesion  is  concerning.  Your  liver  function  tests  showed  a  mild  elevation  in  AFP  to\n\n69.7 and PIVKA II to 109, which were keeping an eye on. Your MELD score is 8, which indicates the\n\nseverity of your liver disease.\n\nPatient: Whats the next step in treatment?\n\nDoctor:  We're  considering  a  liver  transplant  as  a  definitive  treatment  option,  but  for  now,  we  are\n\n\fplanning to proceed with TACE, as it is a less invasive alternative. Well also keep monitoring your\n\ncondition closely with MR liver dynamics and CT scans.\n\nPatient: I understand. I had my TACE done on 30th September 2024, and it seems to have helped,\n\nas I havent had any active complaints since then.\n\nDoctor: Yes, your condition seems stable, and your latest lab results show no significant changes in\n\nyour  liver  function.  Your  AFP  was  568  pre-TACE,  but  now  it  has  decreased.  Well  continue  with\n\nregular surveillance. Youll need an EGD to monitor varices and a follow-up CT scan for HCC.\n\nPatient: How are things looking now?\n\nDoctor: Based on your latest follow-up on 16th January 2025, your HCV RNA is still not detected.\n\nYour sodium levels are stable, and your creatinine is within normal limits. Youre doing well after the\n\nTACE,  and  well  continue  monitoring  your  condition.  The  CT  scan  from  22nd  January  2025  shows\n\ngood  response  in  the  treated  lesion,  with  no  signs  of  recurrence.  There's  a  slight  decrease  in  the\n\nsize of the gastro-hepatic lymph nodes, and no new lesions have appeared.\n\nPatient: Thats reassuring. So, I dont need to worry about any new growth for now?\n\nDoctor:  For  now,  theres  no  evidence  of  recurrent  disease,  which  is  good  news.  Well  continue\n\nsurveillance  with  a  CT  scan  and  EGD.  Your  liver  function  is  stable,  and  theres  no  evidence  of\n\npulmonary or bone metastasis.\n\nPatient: Thats a relief, doctor. Whats the next step?\n\nDoctor:  Well  continue  with  your  current  plan.  Well  do  another  EGD  in  4  weeks,  follow  up  with  CT\n\n\fscans for HCC protocol, and see you for another check-up in 4 weeks. Keep taking your prescribed\n\nmedications, and well monitor your condition closely.\n\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. Ill make sure to follow the plan.\n\nLab Results:\n\nHB: 12.1\n\nTLC: 6.7\n\nPLT: 69\n\nT-BIL: 0.9\n\nD-BIL: 0.4\n\nALT: 37\n\nAST: 20\n\nALP: 87\n\nAlbumin: 3.5\n\nCreatinine: 1.0\n\n\fNa+: 136\n\nK+: 3.8\n\nINR: 1.2\n\nAFP: 69.7\n\nPIVKA II: 109\n\nCTP: A6\n\nMELD Na: 8\n\nECOG: 0\n\nBMI: 27.39\n\nBlood Group: AB+ve\n\n\f",

How are you today?\n\nPatient: I'm doing well, thank you. Im here as a potential donor for my mother.\n\nDoctor: Alright, lets go over some details. Youre Ahmad Raza, 25 years old, from Sarghodha, and\n\nyou are single, correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, thats correct.\n\nDoctor: And youre considering being a living donor for your mother, Samina Bibi, who is undergoing\n\nliver transplant. Her MRN is 788437, and her blood type is A+. Is that right?\n\nPatient: Yes, thats right. My mom is suffering from HCV-related decompensated cirrhosis of the liver\n\n(DCLD).\n\nDoctor: Exactly. Your mothers Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score is B8, and her MELD score is 22.\n\nThese scores help us understand the severity of her condition. Now, lets go over your health status.\n\nAre you having any active complaints?\n\nPatient: No, I dont have any complaints at the moment.\n\n\fDoctor: Good to hear. Any recent history of blood transfusions, fevers, or night sweats?\n\nPatient:  No,  Ive  never  had  any  blood  transfusions,  and  I  havent  experienced  any  fevers  or  night\n\nsweats.\n\nDoctor: Thats great. How about your past medical history or surgeries?\n\nPatient: No significant medical or surgical history. Im healthy.\n\nDoctor: Any allergies?\n\nPatient: No allergies.\n\nDoctor:  Lets  talk  a  little  bit  about  your  social  and  economic  situation.  Do  you  have  any  financial\n\nconcerns or strains related to this?\n\nPatient: Yes, there are some financial concerns, but nothing major.\n\nDoctor: I understand. And your education level?\n\nPatient: Im an LLB student.\n\nDoctor: Single, with no addictions to smoking, alcohol, or tobacco?\n\nPatient: Yes, thats correct.\n\n\fDoctor: Now, lets move on to the psychological screening. Are you feeling depressed at all?\n\nPatient: No, Im doing fine mentally.\n\nDoctor: Any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?\n\nPatient: No, nothing like that.\n\nDoctor: Good. Lets proceed with the physical and cognitive screening. Theres no language barrier,\n\nno speech or visual impairments, and no cognitive or mobility issues, correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, thats all correct.\n\nDoctor:  Ill  move  on  to  the  physical  examination.  Your  abdomen  is  soft,  non-tender,  and\n\nnon-distended,  which  is  great.  Your  respiratory  and  cardiovascular  systems  are  normal,  with\n\nbilateral  normal  vesicular  breathing  and  normal  heart  sounds.  Your  consciousness  and  orientation\n\nare intact, and your GCS score is 15/15.\n\nPatient: Thats a relief.\n\nDoctor: As for investigations, there are no major findings at the moment. Lets review your vitals. For\n\nyou, the donor: your blood pressure is 122/73, heart rate is 73, temperature is 36.4\u00b0C, SpO2 is 98%,\n\nheight is 175 cm, weight is 65 kg, and BMI is 21.2. For your mother, the recipient: her weight is 43\n\nkg, and her BMI is 19.11.\n\nPatient: Okay, I understand the numbers.\n\n\fDoctor: Regarding the donor risk, there is a mortality risk of 0.5% (1 in 200) and morbidity risks of\n\n15-20%,  which  includes  potential  liver  failure,  deep  vein  thrombosis,  pulmonary  embolism,\n\npneumonia,  incisional  hernia,  and  biliary  leaks  or  strictures,  which  might  require  interventions  like\n\nendoscopy, radiology, or surgery.\n\nPatient: I understand the risks involved, doctor. Im ready to proceed.\n\nDoctor: As part of the donor hepatectomy, we will also perform a cholecystectomy. Weve explained\n\nall these risks to you, and you seem to understand them well.\n\nPatient: Yes, I understand everything.\n\nDoctor: Great. The next step is to proceed with Step 1. Youll need to go through further evaluations.\n\nPatient: Okay, thank you, doctor. Im ready to continue with the process.\n\nDoctor: You're welcome. If you have any more questions, don't hesitate to ask.\n\nPatient: Ill reach out if I have any concerns. Thank you!\n\nDoctor: Take care, Ahmad. We'll be in touch soon.\n\n\f",

I see you are here for the evaluation of potential liver donation. Let's go over\n\nyour medical history first.\n\nPatient: Sure, Doctor.\n\nDoctor: How have you been feeling lately? Any active complaints?\n\nPatient: No, I don't have any active complaints.\n\nDoctor: Alright. Let me ask you about your medical history. Have you had any prior medical issues\n\nor surgeries?\n\nPatient:  No,  no  medical  history.  I  havent  had  any  surgeries  either,  except  for  a  normal  vaginal\n\ndelivery a year ago.\n\nDoctor: Thats good to know. Have you had any allergies?\n\nPatient: No allergies.\n\nDoctor:  Okay.  Now,  lets  move  to  your  social  background.  Do  you  have  any  religious,  cultural,  or\n\nspiritual needs that we should be aware of for your care?\n\n\fPatient: No, nothing in particular.\n\nDoctor: Any financial strains or issues that could affect your treatment?\n\nPatient: No, everything is fine financially.\n\nDoctor: And your education level?\n\nPatient: I have a bachelor's degree.\n\nDoctor: What about your occupation?\n\nPatient: Im a housewife, and I have two children.\n\nDoctor: Do you have any addictions, like smoking or alcohol?\n\nPatient: No, none of that.\n\nDoctor: Alright, and now let's talk about your family history. Are there any conditions like diabetes,\n\nhypertension, cancer, or asthma in your family?\n\nPatient: No, theres nothing of that sort in my family history.\n\nDoctor:  Moving  on  to  psychological  screening.  Have  you  ever  felt  depressed  or  had  any  suicidal\n\nthoughts?\n\nPatient: No, not at all. Ive never had those thoughts.\n\n\fDoctor: Thats reassuring. Now, any issues with language, speech, vision, or cognitive abilities?\n\nPatient: No, everything is normal in that regard.\n\nDoctor: Let me ask you about your menstrual history. Any issues there?\n\nPatient: No, everything is fine.\n\nDoctor:  Lets  proceed  with  the  examination.  Your  abdomen  is  soft,  non-tender,  and  non-distended.\n\nYour  lungs  are  clear  with  normal  breathing  sounds,  and  your  heart  sounds  are  normal  without\n\nmurmurs. Neurologically, you are conscious and oriented, and your GCS score is 15 out of 15.\n\nDoctor: Now, lets review the lab results and vital signs.\n\nFor the donor:\n\nBlood Pressure: 107/72\n\nHeart Rate: 66 beats per minute\n\nTemperature: 36.4\u00b0C\n\nOxygen Saturation: 99%\n\nHeight: 165 cm\n\n\fWeight: 83 kg\n\nBMI: 30.5\n\nFor the recipient:\n\nBlood Pressure: 124/60\n\nHeart Rate: 115 beats per minute\n\nTemperature: 36.2\u00b0C\n\nOxygen Saturation: 98%\n\nHeight: 77 cm\n\nWeight: 7 kg\n\nDoctor: Your donor risk assessment shows a 0.5% mortality risk and a 15-20% morbidity risk. The\n\nrisks include liver failure, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, incisional hernia,\n\nand  biliary  leaks,  which  may  require  interventions.  As  part  of  the  donor  hepatectomy,  a\n\ncholecystectomy will also be performed. These risks have been explained to you.\n\nPatient: Yes, I understand the risks involved.\n\nDoctor:  Good.  Now,  lets  move  forward  with  the  plan.  Youll  need  to  get  blood  tests  and  an\n\nultrasound. Also, please meet with Mr. Touseef for further discussions.\n\n\fPatient: Okay, I will do that.\n\nDoctor:  Great.  Let  me  summarize  the  plan  for  you.  Youve  been  educated  about  living  donor  liver\n\ntransplantation (LDLT), and you understand the associated risk factors. We'll proceed with Step 1:\n\nblood tests and ultrasound.\n\nFollow-up visits:\n\nDoctor (November 13, 2024): I noticed you didn't show up for your appointment today.\n\nPatient: Yes, something came up, and I couldn't make it.\n\nDoctor  (November  20,  2024):  Let's  review  your  latest  gynecology  examination.  Your  ultrasound\n\nshows that your uterus is anteverted, measuring 9.2 x 3.4 x 5.6 cm, and the endometrium is 4 mm\n\nthick.  Your  right  ovary  measures  3.1  x  1.5  x  2.8  cm  with  a  volume  of  7.3  ml,  and  your  left  ovary\n\nmeasures 2.6 x 1.8 x 3.7 cm with a volume of 9.6 ml. No gross pelvic pathology was found.\n\nPatient: Okay, Doctor.\n\nDoctor: Your beta HCG is less than 0.1, which is normal. Also, the pap smear kit was unavailable,\n\nbut there are no risk factors for cervical or endometrial cancer. You have a curdy white discharge,\n\nbut otherwise, the examination is normal.\n\nPatient: What does that mean?\n\nDoctor: It seems like you have vaginal candidiasis, which is a fungal infection. I recommend taking\n\n\fCanestein tablets once per week for three weeks. After that, youll be fit to proceed with the donation\n\nprocess.\n\nPatient: Understood. Thank you, Doctor.\n\n\f",

Its been really bothering me, along with some diarrhea.\n\nDoctor:  I  understand.  Let  me  ask  you  some  more  details.  You've  had  hepatitis  B  (HBV)  for  many\n\nyears, is that correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, Ive had HBV since 2008, and Ive been treated with DAAs. However, the last time I had\n\na  PCR  test  for  hepatitis  B,  it  came  back  positive.  The  result  from  August  6,  2024,  showed  a  viral\n\nload of 216,811 IU/mL.\n\nDoctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that. Regarding your symptoms of RUQ pain and itching, well\n\nneed  to  look  into  your  condition  closely.  Have  you  experienced  any  of  the  following  symptoms\n\nrecentlyvomiting blood, swelling in your abdomen, jaundice, or black stools?\n\nPatient:  No,  none  of  those.  I  havent  had  any  bleeding,  and  my  weight  loss  is  not  documented.  I\n\nhavent had any fevers or night sweats either.\n\nDoctor: I see. And do you have any history of blood transfusions or any previous surgeries?\n\nPatient: No, I dont have any history of blood transfusions or surgeries.\n\nDoctor: Alright. And do you know if youre allergic to any medications?\n\n\fPatient: Im allergic to some medications, but Im not sure exactly which ones.\n\nDoctor: Noted. I see you're currently taking Entecavir 0.5mg once daily. Is that correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, thats correct.\n\nDoctor:  Lets  also  take  a  look  at  your  general  health.  Do  you  have  any  financial  strains  or  cultural\n\nneeds I should be aware of for your care?\n\nPatient: Yes, I have some financial issues, and I am uneducated. I work as a farmer and Im married\n\nwith  three  children.  I  used  to  use  Naswaar  for  20  years  but  have  stopped  using  it  for  the  past  20\n\nyears.\n\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. It seems your family history is unremarkable, and there are no\n\nsignificant psychological concerns, is that right?\n\nPatient: Yes, thats correct. No depression or suicidal thoughts, and no history of self-harm.\n\nDoctor: Good to know. Lets move on to your physical exam. You seem well-oriented and conscious,\n\nwith  no  issues  in  speech,  cognition,  or  mobility.  Your  physical  exam  shows  a  soft,  non-tender,\n\nnon-distended abdomen, and normal lung and heart sounds.\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds right.\n\nDoctor: Ive reviewed your recent investigations, including your CT scan from August 12, 2024. The\n\nscan  shows  an  arterially  enhancing  lesion  in  the  right  hepatic  lobe  with  washout  on  subsequent\n\n\fphases, which suggests hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Theres also a right renal cortical cyst, but\n\nno evidence of cirrhosis.\n\nPatient: Thats concerning. What does this mean for me?\n\nDoctor: The diagnosis of HCC is concerning, but were not seeing any vascular invasion in your liver.\n\nWell  need  to  consider  treatment  options.  A  possible  treatment  is  Radiofrequency  Ablation  (RFA),\n\nand  well  discuss  with  interventional  radiology  if  this  is  suitable  for  you.  Ill  also  continue  your\n\nEntecavir  for  hepatitis  B,  but  well  adjust  the  treatment  plan  after  we  complete  the  ablation  or\n\nresection.\n\nPatient: I understand. Whats the plan for now?\n\nDoctor:  We  need  to  repeat  some  investigations.  I  recommend  getting  a  fresh  CT  scan  and\n\nperforming  the  remaining  baseline  tests.  Once  we  have  those  results,  well  plan  the  next  steps,\n\nincluding possible surgery or RFA. Lets follow up after these investigations.\n\nFollow-up Visit (20-08-24)\n\nPatient:  Doctor,  Im  back  for  my  follow-up.  The  pain  in  my  RUQ  is  still  troubling  me,  and  Ive  had\n\nsome nausea and diarrhea as well. Ive been on Entecavir as per the last plan.\n\nDoctor: Its good to see you again. From what I understand, youve been on Entecavir for your HBV,\n\nand  we  had  discussed  a  possible  procedure  for  the  HCC.  The  CT  scan  you  had  on  August  12\n\nshowed  a  lesion  in  your  liver.  It  was  confirmed  as  HCC,  and  were  now  considering  RFA.  Did  you\n\nhave any significant changes since the last visit?\n\n\fPatient: I havent noticed anything new, except for the ongoing pain and some discomfort from the\n\nitching.\n\nDoctor:  Alright,  we  will  refer  you  to  interventional  radiology  for  the  RFA  procedure,  and  I  want  to\n\nensure  we  manage  the  pain  effectively.  Ill  add  pain  relief  medication  as  well,  including  Tramadol\n\n50mg twice daily, and well continue monitoring your liver function.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor.\n\nDoctor:  You're  welcome.  We'll  continue  the  Entecavir,  and  after  RFA,  we'll  reassess  the  hepatitis\n\ntreatment.  Lets  also  plan  a  follow-up  in  about  four  weeks  to  check  on  your  progress  and  repeat\n\nsome lab tests, including your AFP levels and a new HBV PCR.\n\nFollow-up Visit (11-09-24)\n\nDoctor: How have you been feeling since your last visit?\n\nPatient: The pain is still there, but Ive been managing it with the medication. My liver function tests\n\nwere high last time, but now theyve improved.\n\nDoctor: Good to hear. Your latest tests from August 19 show improvements in your liver function, but\n\nthe  AFP  levels  are  still  elevated  at  220.  Were  still  looking  at  the  3.5  cm  HCC  without  vascular\n\ninvasion.  The  microwave  ablation  procedure  was  delayed  due  to  high  liver  enzymes,  but  it  seems\n\nwere moving forward now.\n\nPatient: Yes, Im hoping the procedure will help with the pain.\n\n\fDoctor: Absolutely, well monitor you closely after the procedure. The liver function is improving, and\n\nwell reassess your CT scan and AFP levels soon. In the meantime, continue with your medications,\n\nand follow-up in a month.\n\nFollow-up Visit (25-10-24)\n\nPatient: Im here for my follow-up visit. The pain has improved, but Im still concerned about the HCC.\n\nDoctor: I understand your concern. Youve had your microwave ablation on September 26, and your\n\nliver  function  tests  have  improved  since  then.  Your  AFP  remains  elevated  at  220,  but  your  liver\n\nfunction tests are showing positive changes.\n\nPatient: Yes, I noticed some improvement, but the pain is still lingering.\n\nDoctor:  Thats  expected,  but  we  will  continue  monitoring.  Your  CT  scan  from  September  19\n\nconfirmed  the  3.5  cm  HCC  with  no  vascular  invasion.  No  extrahepatic  metastasis  was  found.  The\n\nnext  steps  are  to  follow  up  with  another  AFP  test  and  a  PCR  for  HBV  in  three  months.  We'll  also\n\nrepeat a CT scan in two weeks to monitor the situation.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.\n\nDoctor:  Youre  welcome.  Continue  your  Entecavir,  and  lets  touch  base  in  a  month  for  your  next\n\nfollow-up. We'll adjust the plan as necessary.\n\nConsultant Addendum (25-10-24)\n\nDoctor: Ive reviewed the care plan and agree with the steps weve taken so far. Keep up with your\n\n\fmedications and follow-up as scheduled.\n\nFollow-up Visit (20-12-24)\n\nDoctor: I see youre here for your reports. How have you been feeling since your last visit?\n\nPatient:  The  pain  has  decreased,  but  I  still  have  some  discomfort.  Ive  been  on  Entecavir,  and  the\n\nmicrowave ablation was done in September.\n\nDoctor:  Your  HCC  was  treated  with  microwave  ablation,  and  your  liver  function  is  improving.  The\n\nAFP remains at 220, and were awaiting the results of your next AFP test. Well also repeat the HBV\n\nPCR  in  three  months.  The  plan  is  to  follow  up  after  two  weeks  with  another  CT  scan  and  further\n\nblood work to assess the situation.\n\nPatient: Ill continue with the medications and follow-up as instructed.\n\nDoctor:  Thats  the  best  approach.  We'll  keep  monitoring  your  progress  closely.  Lets  meet  again  in\n\ntwo weeks for the follow-up on the CT and AFP levels.\n\n\f",

Let's  review  your  history.  You  were  diagnosed  with  HCV  in  2011  and\n\nhave  been  through  treatment.  You  took  interferon  therapy  for  one  year  and  later  started  DAAs  in\n\n2016. You achieved a sustained virologic response (SVR), and your last PCR on 3rd October 2020\n\nshowed that HCV was not detected.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, thats right.\n\nDoctor:\n\nGood.  Now,  in  terms  of  decompensations,  you've  reported  no  hematemesis,  ascites,  hepatic\n\nencephalopathy (PSE), jaundice, or melena. Thats a good sign.\n\nPatient:\n\nIve never had those issues, thankfully.\n\nDoctor:\n\nGlad to hear. Now, I understand that you've lost about 7 kg in the last month. Can you share more\n\nabout that?\n\n\fPatient:\n\nYes, I noticed my weight dropping recently, but I didnt keep track of it properly.\n\nDoctor:\n\nOkay,  thats  important  information.  Lets  move  on  to  the  scans.  You  had  an  ultrasound  of  your\n\nabdomen on 19th April 2021 from DHQ Sahiwal, which showed a focal solid lesion with well-defined\n\nmargins in segment 4 of the liver, measuring 3.9 x 3.9 cm. There was no ascites.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, I remember that.\n\nDoctor:\n\nOn  the  CT  scan  from  Chughtai  on  7th  May  2021,  it  showed  a  non-cirrhotic  liver  with  a  focal\n\narterialized hepatic lesion in segment 7, measuring 3.9 x 4.3 cm, along with sub-centimeter lymph\n\nnodes at the porta hepatis. The spleen was normal, and there was no ascites.\n\nPatient:\n\nI see.\n\nDoctor:\n\nLets review your lab results from 6th May 2021:\n\nHemoglobin (HB): 14.3\n\nTotal Leukocyte Count (TLC): 7.1\n\n\fPlatelets (PLT): 161\n\nTotal Bilirubin (T-BIL): 0.9\n\nDirect Bilirubin (D-BIL): 0.3\n\nALT: 56, AST: 40\n\nAlkaline Phosphatase (ALP): 80\n\nAlbumin: 4.3\n\nCreatinine: 0.6\n\nSodium (Na+):\n\nPotassium (K+):\n\nINR: 1.2\n\nAFP (Alpha-Fetoprotein): 5.4\n\nPatient:\n\nOkay.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI also see your anti-HCV test from 19th April 2021 came back negative, which is a good result.\n\n\fPatient:\n\nThat's reassuring.\n\nDoctor:\n\nWell need to keep an eye on your condition. We discussed your case with the multidisciplinary team\n\n(MDT) on 18th May 2021. You were advised to submit the CD of your CT scan for further evaluation.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, I did that.\n\nFollow-up Visit on 12th July 2021\n\nPatient:\n\nI havent had any new symptoms since our last visit, but Im still feeling the effects of the weight loss.\n\nDoctor:\n\nUnderstood. Looking at your history again, you had an SVR with your HCV treatment. Your last PCR\n\nfrom 3rd October 2020 was negative.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, I havent had any viral issues since.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThats  good  news.  Your  CT  scan  from  7th  May  2021  still  shows  a  non-cirrhotic  liver  with  an\n\narterialized hepatic lesion in segment 7, measuring 3.9 x 4.3 cm.\n\n\fPatient:\n\nYes, that lesion is still there.\n\nDoctor:\n\nIn addition, your MRI on 18th May 2021 showed a non-cirrhotic liver and a hepatic lesion in segment\n\n7, measuring 4.8 x 3.7 cm. This lesion demonstrates diffusion restriction and shows intense arterial\n\nphase enhancement with contrast washout in the venous phase.\n\nPatient:\n\nSo, what does that mean for me?\n\nDoctor:\n\nIts  an  indication  of  possible  hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC),  especially  given  its  behavior  on  the\n\nMRI.  The  lesion  is  abutting  the  right  hepatic  vein  branches  but  shows  no  evidence  of  venous\n\ninvasion. The portal vein is patent, and theres no significant biliary dilation.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhats the next step?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWe will continue monitoring it. Your lab results on 5th July 2021 showed:\n\nHemoglobin (HB): 13.3\n\nTotal Leukocyte Count (TLC): 8.3\n\nPlatelets (PLT): 431\n\n\fTotal Bilirubin (T-BIL): 0.43\n\nDirect Bilirubin (D-BIL): 0.13\n\nALT: 24, AST: 21\n\nAlkaline Phosphatase (ALP): 116\n\nAlbumin: 4.1\n\nCreatinine: 0.64\n\nSodium (Na+): 139\n\nPotassium (K+): 4.2\n\nINR: 0.9\n\nAFP: 5.4\n\nYour  MELD-Na  score  is  6,  and  your  Child-Pugh  class  is  5/A,  which  indicates  relatively  preserved\n\nliver function.\n\nPatient:\n\nI see.\n\n\fDoctor:\n\nYour liver biopsy from 6th July 2021 showed moderate steatosis (33-66%), with a METAVIR score\n\nof A1/A3 for activity and F1/F4 for fibrosis. We also did a Fibroscan on 6th July 2021, which showed\n\nno fibrosis (F0) and no steatosis (S0).\n\nPatient:\n\nSo, whats the diagnosis now?\n\nDoctor:\n\nThe  lesion  is  consistent  with  HCC,  and  its  being  monitored  carefully.  Youve  already  had  TACE\n\n(Transarterial Chemoembolization) done on 21st June 2021 to treat the lesion.\n\nPatient:\n\nWill I need more treatment?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWell  continue  to  monitor  your  condition.  The  MDT  will  discuss  your  case  further,  and  we  may\n\nconsider additional treatment options if needed.\n\nPatient:\n\nOkay, thank you for the update, doctor.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYou're welcome. Let's keep track of your condition, and well decide on the next steps together.         \n\n         Patient:\n\nHello, doctor. Im here for my follow-up visit after my wedge resection surgery.\n\n\fDoctor:\n\nHi! Good to see you. How have you been since your last visit?\n\nPatient:\n\nIve  been  okay,  but  Ive  been  feeling  some  weakness  for  the  past  month,  and  Ive  also  been\n\nexperiencing some dyspepsia.\n\nDoctor:\n\nAlright, lets go over your recent medical information and make sure everything is on track. As you\n\nknow, you had surgery for a solitary HCC in segment VII of the liver back in August 2021. How have\n\nyou been recovering since?\n\nPatient:\n\nThe  recovery  was  uneventful  until  I  was  diagnosed  with  mild  COVID-19  on  August  14,  2021,  and\n\nwas shifted to HPTC. I was discharged from there on August 17, 2021.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI see. And how is your breathing now? Any shortness of breath?\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, I still experience some shortness of breath on exertion.\n\nDoctor:\n\nNoted.  Lets  go  over  your  latest  imaging  results.  You  had  a  USG  of  the  abdomen  on  August  12,\n\n2021, which showed a collection in segment VII measuring 5.8 x 5.3 x 5.1 cm, corresponding to a\n\nvolume of 83 ml. There was no ascites, but mild right-sided pleural effusion was seen. Your recent\n\nCT scan from August 24, 2021, confirmed a collection in segment VII, now measuring 4.2 x 3.8 x 0.1\n\n\fcm (about 18.3 ml). The drain tip was in place, and there was minimal pleural effusion.\n\nPatient:\n\nThat sounds concerning. Should I be worried about the collection?\n\nDoctor:\n\nNot necessarily. Its a normal post-surgical finding, but well continue to monitor it closely. Your drain\n\noutput is around 25 ml over the past few days, which is serosanguinous, indicating a good drainage\n\nprocess.\n\nPatient:\n\nSo, whats the plan moving forward?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWe  will  continue  with  your  current  medication,  Rivaroxaban  10mg  daily  for  the  next  21  days.\n\nRegarding your drain, Ill assess whether its time to remove it after a follow-up USG. Id also like to\n\nmonitor  your  liver  function  and  perform  some  routine  blood  tests,  including  CBC,  LFT,  RFT,  and\n\nINR,  to  keep  track  of  your  recovery.  Additionally,  Id  like  a  CT  scan  of  your  liver  using  the  HCC\n\nprotocol for surveillance of any potential recurrence.\n\nPatient:\n\nGot it. Ill make sure to follow up on the tests.\n\nDoctor:\n\nGood.  Lets  also  discuss  the  results  of  your  histopathology.  Your  resected  specimen  showed\n\nwell-differentiated  (G1)  solitary  HCC,  1.5  cm  in  size,  with  internal  necrosis  (30%  viable  tumor).\n\nImportantly,  there  was  no  vascular,  biliary,  or  perineural  invasion,  and  all  margins  were  free  of\n\n\ftumor. This is great news. Your surrounding liver tissue showed mild fibrosis (F1).\n\nPatient:\n\nThat sounds promising.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYes, its reassuring. Youre recovering well, but we need to be vigilant in monitoring for any signs of\n\nrecurrence. Id like to follow up in a few months with another CT scan and blood work, including AFP,\n\nto keep an eye on things.\n\nPatient:\n\nSounds like a good plan. Thank you, doctor.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYoure welcome! Keep taking care of yourself, and well see you soon for the follow-up.\n\nPatient:  \"Doctor,  I  have  been  feeling  a  bit  anxious  about  my  health.  Could  we  go  over  my  latest\n\ntests?\"\n\nDoctor:  \"Of  course.  Let's  take  a  look  at  your  lab  results  and  recent  imaging.  I'll  guide  you  through\n\neverything.\"\n\nPatient:  \"Thank  you.  Here's  what  I've  got.  My  hemoglobin  levels  have  been  steady,  around  14.43\n\ng/dL in December 2021, and its now at 14.7 g/dL as of January 2024. Is that normal?\"\n\nDoctor:  \"Yes,  your  hemoglobin  levels  are  stable  and  within  the  healthy  range.  Theyre  a  good\n\nindicator that your blood health is on track.\"\n\n\fPatient: \"Good to know. What about my total leukocyte count (TLC)? It was 7.86 in December 2021\n\nand dropped to 6.0 in January 2024.\"\n\nDoctor:  \"Your  TLC  has  slightly  decreased  but  is  still  within  normal  limits.  Its  not  something  to  be\n\nconcerned about at the moment.\"\n\nPatient:  \"I  also  noticed  that  my  platelet  count  has  fluctuated.  It  was  197.8  in  December  2021,\n\ndropped to 100 in December 2022, then improved to 180 in May 2023, and is now at 130 in January\n\n2024. Is that something to worry about?\"\n\nDoctor:  \"Platelet  count  can  vary,  but  the  numbers  are  still  within  an  acceptable  range.  Your  count\n\nmight reflect some minor fluctuations but not something we need to be overly concerned about for\n\nnow.\"\n\nPatient: \"Okay, that's a relief. What about my bilirubin levels? My total bilirubin was 0.6 in December\n\n2021, 0.43 in May 2022, 0.44 in December 2022, and 0.52 in January 2024.\"\n\nDoctor:  \"Your  total  bilirubin  is  slightly  elevated  but  remains  well  within  normal  levels.  This  is  not\n\nalarming, but well keep an eye on it in future tests.\"\n\nPatient:  \"My  direct  bilirubin  was  0.23  in  December  2021  and  dropped  to  0.12  in  December  2022,\n\nnow it's at 0.18. Is that a significant change?\"\n\nDoctor: \"The direct bilirubin levels have been stable and slightly increased, but nothing to be overly\n\nconcerned about. Its a minor fluctuation.\"\n\n\fPatient: \"My ALT/AST enzymes were 19/19 in December 2021, then 35/24 in May 2022, and 30/22\n\nin April 2023, now 36/28 in January 2024. Should I be worried?\"\n\nDoctor:  \"Your  liver  enzymes  are  a  bit  elevated  compared  to  the  baseline,  but  theyre  still  not  at\n\nalarmingly high levels. Well continue to monitor this, especially considering your liver condition.\"\n\nPatient: \"What about ALP? It was 87 in December 2021 and stayed stable around 80 in 2022 and\n\n2023. It's now at 86 in January 2024.\"\n\nDoctor:  \"ALP  is  stable,  and  its  good  to  see  it  hasnt  changed  much.  This  is  within  a  normal  range,\n\nwhich is promising.\"\n\nPatient:  \"And  hows  my  albumin  level?  It  was  4.57  in  December  2021,  4.5  in  May  2022,  4.48  in\n\nDecember 2022, and is now 4.5 in January 2024.\"\n\nDoctor: \"Your albumin levels are stable, which is a positive sign that your liver is functioning well and\n\nyoure not experiencing significant protein loss.\"\n\nPatient: \"How about my creatinine? It was 0.76 in May 2022, 0.84 in April 2023, and 0.83 in January\n\n2024.\"\n\nDoctor: \"Your creatinine levels have remained steady and are within normal limits. This shows that\n\nyour kidney function is also stable.\"\n\nPatient: \"My sodium was 139 in December 2021, 140 in May 2022, 140 in April 2023, and is now\n\n138. Should I be concerned?\"\n\n\fDoctor:  \"Your  sodium  is  slightly  lower  in  January,  but  it's  still  within  a  normal  range.  Theres  no\n\nimmediate concern here.\"\n\nPatient:  \"What  about  my  potassium?  It  was  4.3  in  December  2021,  4.2  in  May  2022,  3.9  in  April\n\n2023, and now 4.43 in January 2024.\"\n\nDoctor: \"Your potassium levels are a bit higher now, which is fine as long as its within the reference\n\nrange. Its important to monitor for any symptoms, but it looks good for now.\"\n\nPatient:  \"My  INR  was  1.01  in  December  2021,  0.95  in  May  2022,  1.04  in  April  2023,  and  0.94  in\n\nJanuary 2024. Is this okay?\"\n\nDoctor: \"Your INR is stable and within the healthy range, so theres nothing to worry about here.\"\n\nPatient: \"Hows my AFP? It was 4.64 in December 2021, 4.29 in May 2022, 4.7 in April 2023, and\n\nnow its 5.24 in January 2024.\"\n\nDoctor:  \"Your  AFP  level  has  increased  slightly,  but  its  still  within  the  expected  range  for  someone\n\nwith your condition. Well keep monitoring it.\"\n\nPatient: \"I also see my MELD-Na score. It was 7 in December 2021, 6 in May 2022, 7 in April 2023,\n\nand 8 in January 2024. Should I be concerned?\"\n\nDoctor: \"The MELD-Na score has increased a bit, which reflects some changes in liver function. It's\n\nsomething we need to keep an eye on, but its not an emergency at this point.\"\n\nPatient: \"What about the CT and MRI scans? I know you mentioned some issues.\"\n\n\fDoctor:  \"Yes,  your  imaging  showed  that  the  small  lesion  in  segment  VIII  of  the  liver  could  be  a\n\nrecurrence  of  HCC.  The  latest  MRI  from  January  2024  confirms  a  1.7  cm  lesion,  which  is\n\nconcerning. We'll need to proceed with further evaluations.\"\n\nPatient: \"Whats the next step then?\"\n\nDoctor:  \"Well  discuss  this  with  the  multidisciplinary  team.  For  now,  we'll  look  at  options  like\n\nradiofrequency  ablation  (RFA)  or  surgical  resection.  We  also  need  to  refer  you  to  interventional\n\nradiology for an evaluation.\"\n\nPatient: \"I understand. What should I do next?\"\n\nDoctor:  \"I  recommend  that  we  arrange  for  further  imaging  and  review  the  situation  with  our  team.\n\nWe  may  proceed  with  RFA,  and  well  also  monitor  your  overall  liver  health.  Well  discuss  the\n\ntreatment options further based on those results.\"\n\nPatient: \"I see. Thank you for explaining everything to me, Doctor.\"\n\nDoctor: \"You're welcome. We'll stay on top of it and ensure you're getting the best care possible.\"\n\n\f",

    "raw_text": "Gender: Female\n\nAge: 49\n\nMRN: 819357\n\nDiagnosis: Hepatocellular Carcinoma\n\nHistory and Physical:\n\nPatient:\n\nDoctor,  I  came  in  because  I  noticed  a  mass  on  the  right  side  of  my  abdomen.  It  was  found\n\nincidentally during an ultrasound that was done as part of my workup for GERD and APD.\n\nDoctor:\n\nAlright, let me take a look at your records. So, you've had a history of GERD and APD for the past\n\neight  years,  correct?  Also,  I  see  that  your  Anti-HCV  and  HBsAg  were  negative  three  years  ago,\n\nwhich is good.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes,  that's  right.  I  haven't  experienced  any  symptoms  like  hematemesis,  ascites,  jaundice,  or\n\nmelena.  I  also  havent  had  any  significant  weight  loss  or  required  blood  transfusions.  No  fever  or\n\nnight sweats either.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThat's  helpful  to  know.  I  see  you  have  a  history  of  being  diabetic  and  hypertensive,  but  you're\n\ncompliant  with  your  medications.  You \n\ntake  Thyroxin,  Amlodipine,  Telmisartan,  and\n\nSitagliptin/Metformin. Is that correct?\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, Ive been taking those as prescribed. Also, I have no allergies.\n\n\fDoctor:\n\nGreat,  let's  talk  about  your  family  history.  I  can  see  that  your  father  had  Ewing  sarcoma  and\n\ncolorectal cancer. Do you have any other family members with significant health conditions?\n\nPatient:\n\nNo, that's the only notable family history.\n\nDoctor:\n\nAlright.  I  see  there  are  no  psychological  concerns,  and  you're  not  experiencing  any  cognitive  or\n\nphysical limitations. Your general health seems to be in good shape.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, I don't have any issues with language, speech, vision, or mobility.\n\nDoctor:\n\nNow, let's take a look at your lab results and imaging. Your ultrasound from August 12th showed a\n\nfatty liver with moderate hepatomegaly, and a solid mass measuring 10 x 9.8 cm, inseparable from\n\nthe liver. The CT scan from August 16th shows a large exophytic mass arising from the inferior edge\n\nof  segment  VI  extending  into  the  subhepatic  space.  This  feature  suggests  it  could  be  a  primary\n\nhepatocellular  lesion  of  the  fibrolamellar  variety  or  possibly  a  neuroendocrine  tumor.  However,\n\nmetastatic disease is unlikely.\n\nPatient:\n\nSo, is it something malignant?\n\nDoctor:\n\nIt  could  be,  but  the  biopsy  performed  on  August  28th  didnt  show  any  malignant  cells.  The  biopsy\n\n\frevealed  unremarkable  liver  parenchyma  with  fibrosis  and  dilated  vessels,  so  it's  possible  that  the\n\nsample was taken from the perilesional area. There's also a chance that this mass could represent\n\nfocal nodular hyperplasia.\n\nPatient:\n\nThats a relief to hear. What are the next steps?\n\nDoctor:\n\nI agree, its encouraging, but we still need to be cautious. Well need to submit the CD of the CT scan\n\ndone from outside for further analysis. The MRI liver dynamics will also be important for discussion\n\nin  the  multidisciplinary  team  (MDT)  meeting.  Based  on  the  results,  were  planning  for  a  wedge\n\nresection of the tumor.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhen can I expect to get more details?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWell follow up with the MDTs decision on Tuesday. Your brother has already been informed about\n\nyour current disease status, and he was given detailed information. The next step will be based on\n\nthat outcome.\n\n(Follow-Up Visit - 19/09/24)\n\nPatient:\n\nIve brought the CD of my CT scan as requested.\n\nDoctor:\n\n\fLets  take  a  look.  The  CT  scan  shows  a  large  exophytic  mass  arising  from  the  inferior  edge  of\n\nsegment VI, extending into the subhepatic space. The size is approximately 11 x 9.9 x 9.8 cm. It still\n\nappears to be a primary hepatocellular lesion, potentially fibrolamellar, but we need to rule out other\n\npossibilities.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhat did the biopsy show?\n\nDoctor:\n\nThe core biopsy from August 28th showed unremarkable liver parenchyma with fibrosis and dilated\n\nvessels.  This  suggests  the  biopsy  was  taken  from  the  perilesional  area,  or  it  could  indicate  focal\n\nnodular hyperplasia, not malignancy.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhats next?\n\nDoctor:\n\nThe next step will be to submit the CD of the CT scan done from outside. Well also be discussing\n\nthe case in the MDT meeting and planning for a wedge resection of the tumor. Well also conduct an\n\nMRI liver dynamics study for further evaluation.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhat do you think the outcome will be?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWell have a clearer picture after the MDT discussion. The lesion could be benign, but we need to\n\nrule out other possibilities. Well proceed with the wedge resection if necessary.\n\n\f(Follow-Up Call - 24/09/24)\n\nDoctor:\n\nHello, this is the follow-up regarding your case. The MDT outcome was discussed, and the plan is to\n\nmove forward with the wedge resection of the tumor. Well need to schedule the surgery soon.\n\nPatient:\n\nThank you for keeping me updated. What are the next steps for surgery?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWe will review the MRI results, finalize the surgical plan, and prepare you for the wedge resection. Ill\n\nschedule the surgery after we review the MRI.\n\nLab Results:\n\nTest(cid:9)31/05/24(cid:9)13/08/24\n\nHb(cid:9)10.4(cid:9)11.0\n\nWBC(cid:9)7.0(cid:9)7.6\n\nPLTS(cid:9)338(cid:9)349\n\nTotal-BILI(cid:9)0.3(cid:9)0.3\n\nDirect-BILI(cid:9)0.1(cid:9)0.1\n\nALT/AST(cid:9)36/28(cid:9)36/28\n\nAlk.

    "raw_text": "Gender: Male\n\nAge: 49\n\nMRN: 751795\n\nDiagnosis: Cholangiocarcinoma\n\nHistory and Physical:\n\nPatient:\n\nDoctor, I've been dealing with jaundice for the last two months, along with some abdominal pain.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI see. Can you tell me more about your medical history? Do you have any conditions like diabetes or\n\nhypertension?\n\nPatient:\n\nNo, I dont have diabetes or hypertension. I don't have any significant medical history, except for a\n\npast surgery on my left inguinal hernia about 20 years ago. Unfortunately, I don't have the records\n\nfor that.\n\nDoctor:\n\nUnderstood.  Have  you  experienced  any  other  symptoms  like  fever,  night  sweats,  or  significant\n\nweight loss?\n\nPatient:\n\nNo,  I  havent  had  any  fever  or  night  sweats,  and  I  havent  experienced  any  significant  weight  loss\n\neither.\n\nDoctor:\n\nWhat about any bleeding symptoms like hematemesis or melena?\n\n\fPatient:\n\nNo, nothing like that.\n\nDoctor:\n\nAlright, based on your symptoms and previous examinations, weve been reviewing your CT scans.\n\nYou had a CT scan on the 19th of September, which showed a mass involving the confluence of the\n\nhepatic  ducts,  along  with  some  mild  to  moderate  intrahepatic  biliary  stasis.  This  finding  was\n\nsuggestive  of  a  possible  neoplastic  process,  like  cholangiocarcinoma.  Have  you  been  informed\n\nabout the CT results?\n\nPatient:\n\nYes,  I  was  told  about  the  CT  results.  They  mentioned  a  mass  near  the  porta  hepatis  measuring\n\n4.2x5x3.8 cm, and there was some enlargement of the liver and spleen.\n\nDoctor:\n\nCorrect.  The  mass  appears  to  involve  the  segment  4  extending  to  segment  2,  and  theres\n\nhepatosplenomegaly  with  a  mildly  dilated  portal  vein.  Your  lab  results  from  October  15th  show\n\nelevated  bilirubin  levelstotal  bilirubin  was  7.6  mg/dL  and  direct  bilirubin  was  7.2  mg/dL,  indicating\n\nsome liver dysfunction. Your liver enzymes, ALT and AST, are also elevated, but your albumin level\n\nwas still relatively normal at 4.4.\n\nPatient:\n\nI see.\n\nDoctor:\n\nOn November 1st, another CT scan was done, which further confirmed the presence of intrahepatic\n\n\fcholangiocarcinoma.  This  mass  is  involving  the  left  lobe  of  your  liver  and  extending  into  the  left\n\nhepatic duct and common hepatic duct. Theres also moderate biliary dilatation.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhat does that mean for me?\n\nDoctor:\n\nIt means the cancer is confined to the left lobe and hasn't spread to other parts like the right side of\n\nthe  liver,  and  theres  no  metastatic  disease  at  this  point.  During  a  multidisciplinary  team  (MDT)\n\ndiscussion  on  November  2nd,  we  decided  to  proceed  with  a  plan  to  treat  it  through  surgery.  The\n\nrecommended procedure is a left hepatectomy, where the left side of the liver will be removed, along\n\nwith \n\nthe  excision  of \n\nthe  biliary \n\ntree,  an  extended \n\nlymphadenectomy,  and  a  Roux-en-Y\n\nhepaticojejunostomy.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhat are the chances of success with this surgery?\n\nDoctor:\n\nThis surgery carries a 5-10% risk of death due to complications, but its the best option to remove the\n\ncancer.  However,  there  are  risks  like  infection,  liver  failure,  or  even  the  possibility  of  remaining\n\ncancer  if  the  disease  has  spread  to  areas  not  visible  yet.  If  we  find  metastatic  spread  during  the\n\nsurgery, we would stop the procedure, take a biopsy, and refer you to oncology for chemotherapy.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhat if the cancer has spread?\n\nDoctor:\n\n\fIf  the  cancer  has  spread  to  the  right  hepatic  duct,  we  would  still  proceed  with  the  Roux-en-Y,  but\n\nchemotherapy would be necessary after the surgery. As with any surgery for cancer, there's always\n\na possibility of recurrence, even after removal.\n\nPatient:\n\nThat sounds intense. Could I try ERCP with stenting instead?\n\nDoctor:\n\nERCP  with  stenting  may  help  temporarily  relieve  jaundice,  but  its  not  a  curative  treatment.  The\n\ncancer would remain, and it may not provide long-term relief. Given the seriousness of the condition,\n\nsurgery is still the preferred option.\n\nPatient:\n\nI need some time to think about it.\n\nDoctor:\n\nTake all the time you need. It's a big decision, and I encourage you to discuss it with your family.\n\nOnce you've made your decision, please come back for a follow-up.\n\nPatient:\n\nI will, thank you.\n\nDoctor:\n\nIn  the  meantime,  we  will  continue  to  manage  your  symptoms.  Ill  prescribe  medication  to  help  with\n\nthe jaundice and manage your liver function. Youll take cap urso 250 mg three times a day, ciproxin\n\n500  mg  twice  a  day  for  one  week,  and  Peptamin  powder.  Well  also  need  to  monitor  your  liver\n\nfunction with regular lab tests, and Ive ordered a Fibroscan to check for liver fibrosis, as you have a\n\n\fhistory of alcohol use.\n\nPatient:\n\nI understand. Thank you for explaining everything to me.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYou're welcome. We'll continue monitoring your condition closely and adjust our plan as needed. If\n\nyou have any questions in the meantime, dont hesitate to reach out.\n\nFollow-up Visit (November 15, 2023)\n\nPatient:\n\nDoctor, Ive been continuing the medications, but Im still experiencing jaundice.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYes, your CT scan shows the same findings as before. The mass is still confined to the left lobe and\n\ncommon  bile  ducts,  with  no  metastatic  spread.  Your  liver  function  tests  have  worsened  a  bityour\n\ntotal bilirubin has risen to 20, and your albumin has dropped to 3.8, which indicates worsening liver\n\nfunction.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhat does this mean for my treatment plan?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWe  will  proceed  with  the  surgery  as  planned,  but  your  liver  function  is  something  we  need  to\n\naddress carefully. Your Fibroscan results show cirrhosis (F4) and severe steatosis (S3), indicating\n\nsignificant  liver  damage.  This  may  affect  your  recovery,  so  well  need  to  monitor  your  condition\n\n\fclosely during the surgery and after.\n\nPatient:\n\nWill the surgery still go ahead?\n\nDoctor:\n\nYes, we are still planning for the surgery, but we will need to keep your liver function in mind. The\n\nsurgery remains the best option to treat the cholangiocarcinoma, and well do our best to minimize\n\nany complications.\n\nPatient:\n\nAlright, Ill follow through with the plan.\n\nDoctor:\n\nGreat. Well make sure everything is in place before your surgery. If you have any more questions or\n\nconcerns, dont hesitate to reach out.\n\nPatient:\n\nThank you for all your help, Doctor.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYou're welcome. Were here to support you through this.\n\n\f",

    "raw_text": "Gender: Male\n\nAge: 47\n\nMRN: 794125\n\nDiagnosis: Cholangiocarcinoma\n\nHistory and Physical:\n\nPatient:\n\nDoctor, Ive been feeling very unwell for the last 20 days. I have jaundice, loss of appetite, itching,\n\nand trouble sleeping. Ive also been losing weightabout 5 to 6 kg in the past 20 days.\n\nDoctor:\n\nIm sorry to hear that. Lets go through your medical history. Youve been diagnosed with hepatitis C\n\nfive years ago, and you were treated with interferon and DAAs for three months. You had sustained\n\nviral response, correct?\n\nPatient:\n\nYes,  thats  right.  I  had  treatment  with  interferon  and  DAAs  for  three  months,  and  I  achieved  a\n\nsustained viral response. My last HCV PCR test was on 24th July 2024, and it came back detected.\n\nDoctor:\n\nAlright. Let's take a look at your current condition. You mentioned feeling nauseous, losing weight,\n\nand having jaundice, but no significant issues with hematemesis, ascites, or encephalopathy. Have\n\nyou had any blood transfusions?\n\nPatient:\n\nNo, I havent had any blood transfusions, and I havent been feeling feverish or having night sweats\n\neither.\n\n\fDoctor:\n\nThank you for that information. Your current medications include Urso, Heparitum, Weepo, Jardin,\n\nand  Itopride.  You  have  no  allergies,  and  your  family  medical  history  doesnt  show  any  major\n\nconditions like diabetes, hypertension, cancer, or tuberculosis.\n\nPatient:\n\nCorrect, no allergies or major medical history. Im married with five children and work as a rickshaw\n\ndriver. I dont smoke, drink, or have any addictions. Ive also completed intermediate education.\n\nDoctor:\n\nNoted. On your physical examination, you were conscious and oriented with a Glasgow Coma Scale\n\nof  15/15.  Your  cardiovascular  and  respiratory  systems  were  normal,  and  your  abdomen  was  soft,\n\nnon-tender, and non-distended.\n\nNow, regarding your imaging tests, you had an endoscopy done on 5th August 2024, which showed\n\nerosive  congestive  gastropathy.  Your  ultrasound  report  from  the  same  date  showed  an  enlarged\n\nliver, thick-walled gallbladder, and dilated common bile duct with a soft tissue mass near the head of\n\nthe pancreas. There were also enlarged lymph nodes around the porta hepatis and peripancreatic\n\nregion, but your spleen, kidneys, and pancreas appeared normal.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, I was told about the mass near the pancreas.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYoure correct. Were also waiting on the results of a CT scan, but it hasnt been reported yet.\n\nNow,  let's  look  at  your  lab  results.  Your  hemoglobin  is  stable  at  13.2,  and  your  platelet  count  has\n\n\fincreased  from  174  to  274.  Your  total  bilirubin  has  gone  up  from  18.6  to  27.46,  and  your  direct\n\nbilirubin  from  15.2  to  24.17.  Your  ALT  and  AST  are  also  slightly  elevated,  and  your  alkaline\n\nphosphatase level is down from 642 to 302.\n\nPatient:\n\nSo, what does all of this mean?\n\nDoctor:\n\nThe lab results, especially the rising bilirubin levels, suggest that theres ongoing obstruction of your\n\nbile ducts. Based on your ultrasound and lab results, we are concerned that this may be a malignant\n\nobstruction in your common bile duct (CBD).\n\nPatient:\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWe will need to send fresh labs and do a triphasic CT scan to get a clearer picture. In the meantime,\n\nIve  prescribed  Fenargan  for  your  itching.  Well  also  arrange  for  an  ERCP  (Endoscopic  Retrograde\n\nCholangiopancreatography)  and  stenting.  If  needed,  we  may  discuss  a  Whipple  procedure  as  a\n\ndefinitive treatment. Well wait for the radiology report, and this will be discussed in a multidisciplinary\n\nteam (MDT) meeting.\n\nPatient:\n\nI understand. Thank you, doctor.\n\nFollow-up on 13th August 2024\n\n\fPatient:\n\nDoctor, Im here for a follow-up. My jaundice is still there, and Ive lost more weightanother 5-6 kg in\n\nthe past few weeks. The itching hasnt improved much either.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThank you for updating me. Your weight loss and jaundice are still significant concerns. Your recent\n\nCT  scan  from  12th  August  has  shown  a  heterogeneously  enhancing  mass  in  your  CBD,  which  is\n\nconcerning for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, with involvement of the left biliary system and some\n\nenlarged lymph nodes.\n\nThe  possibility  of  biliary  invasive  hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC)  is  less  likely  but  cannot  be\n\ncompletely excluded. This needs further correlation with tumor markers and viral serology.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhat are the next steps?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWell  proceed  with  a  biopsy  using  endoscopic  ultrasound  to  confirm  the  diagnosis.  Since  your  CT\n\nscan  indicates  a  mass,  Ill  refer  you  to  oncology  for  further  management.  Unfortunately,  based  on\n\nthese findings, it seems you are not a candidate for curative surgery at this time.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhat do you mean by not being a candidate for surgery?\n\nDoctor:\n\nThe mass in your biliary system, along with the enlarged lymph nodes, suggests that this may be a\n\nmetastatic  cancer.  Curative  surgery  would  be  difficult  because  of  the  extent  of  the  disease.\n\n\fHowever, we will continue to explore the best possible treatment options for you.\n\nPatient:\n\nOkay, thank you for explaining, doctor.\n\nFollow-up on 4th September 2024\n\nPatient:\n\nDoctor,  Im  back  for  my  follow-up.  I  still  have  jaundice,  and  the  weight  loss  continues.  The\n\nhemorrhoids are still troubling me too.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI see. Your ultrasound and CT scans confirm that the biliary obstruction is likely due to a mass in the\n\nCBD. The diagnosis is still pointing toward a cholangiocarcinoma, and based on your lab results, we\n\ncan see that your bilirubin is down a little bit, but its still elevated. Your platelets and ALT/AST levels\n\nare stable.\n\nPatient:\n\nIs there anything new in my reports?\n\nDoctor:\n\nYes,  your  lab  results  from  the  latest  tests  are  mostly  similar  to  before,  with  slight  changes  in  your\n\nbilirubin levels. Your CT scan shows a large filling defect in the CBD, consistent with a mass causing\n\nnarrowing and stricture in the biliary system. Well need to proceed with endoscopic ultrasound for\n\nbiopsy and further analysis.\n\nPatient:\n\n\fWhats the next step for treatment?\n\nDoctor:\n\nGiven  that  this  seems  to  be  a  malignancy,  were  focusing  on  supportive  care  and  symptom\n\nmanagement  at  the  moment.  Youll  need  to  see  an  oncologist  for  further  treatment  options,  as\n\nsurgery might not be an option due to the extent of the disease.\n\nPatient:\n\nThank you for everything, doctor.\n\n\f",

    "raw_text": "Gender: Female\n\nAge: 62\n\nMRN: 818344\n\nDiagnosis: Hepatocellular Carcinoma\n\nHistory and Physical:\n\nDoctor: Hello, Shamim. How have you been feeling since your last visit?\n\nPatient:  I've  been  having  some  issues,  Doctor.  I  started  feeling  anorexic,  and  recently,  I  noticed\n\nfresh blood in my stools after taking my medication, Levatinib. Also, I have developed rashes on my\n\nlimbs after taking Levatinib for about 15 days now.\n\nDoctor: I understand. Let's go over your health history to get a clearer picture. You've had diabetes\n\nand  hypertension  for  a  while,  and  this  started  four  months  ago  when  you  began  experiencing\n\nanorexia.  You  were  diagnosed  with  Hepatocellular  Carcinoma  (HCC),  and  thats  why  you  were\n\nreferred to us for further management. You also have a history of Hepatitis C, diagnosed in 2016,\n\nand you successfully achieved Sustained Virologic Response (SVR). Your last HCV PCR on August\n\n5th, 2024, was negative, which is great news.\n\nPatient: Yes, thats right. The HCV was under control, and Ive been following the treatment.\n\nDoctor:  Excellent.  Now,  lets  review  your  current  symptoms.  You  havent  experienced  any\n\nhematemesis  (vomiting  blood),  and  theres  no  significant  ascites  or  jaundice.  Your  weight  loss  has\n\nnot been significant either, and you havent needed any blood transfusions. Additionally, there have\n\nbeen no fevers or night sweats.\n\nPatient: Thats correct, Doctor.\n\n\fDoctor: Great. As for your medical history, youve been managing diabetes and hypertension. Theres\n\nno history of significant surgeries. However, I see you're allergic to contrast agents, so well need to\n\navoid those during any imaging procedures.\n\nPatient: Yes, I remember the reaction I had before.\n\nDoctor:  Understood.  Now,  lets  talk  about  your  current  medications.  Youre  currently  on  Levatinib  4\n\nmg, Sitagliptin, Diabetron 60 mg, Tasmi 20 mg, Carvedilol 6.25 mg, and Omeprazole 40 mg. Have\n\nyou noticed any other side effects or changes since starting Levatinib?\n\nPatient:  The  blood  in  stools  and  rashes  on  my  limbs  are  the  most  noticeable  changes.  No  other\n\nissues so far.\n\nDoctor: Alright, well need to address those concerns. I also see your family history is unremarkable\n\nfor  diabetes,  hypertension,  cancer,  or  other  chronic  diseases.  You  dont  have  any  psychological\n\nissues, and you dont report feeling depressed or having any suicidal thoughts.\n\nPatient: Thats correct, Doctor.\n\nDoctor:  Let's  take  a  look  at  your  examination  results.  You  appear  conscious  and  oriented,  with  a\n\nGCS  of  15/15,  which  is  normal.  Your  cardiovascular  exam  showed  normal  heart  sounds  without\n\nmurmurs,  and  your  respiratory  system  is  fine  with  bilateral  normal  vesicular  breathing.  Your\n\nabdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended.\n\nPatient: Thats reassuring.\n\nDoctor: Lets move on to your investigations. Your most recent ultrasound on July 6th, 2024, showed\n\n\fa  cirrhotic  liver,  a  solitary  solid  liver  mass,  mild  splenomegaly,  and  cholelithiasis.  The  CT  scan  on\n\nAugust  27th,  2024,  revealed  a  well-defined  lesion  in  Segment  IVB,  likely  cholangiocarcinoma  or\n\nmetastatic,  along  with  a  dilated  portal  vein  and  splenomegaly.  We  have  a  recent  CT  scan  from\n\nOctober 3rd, 2024, but the report is still pending.\n\nPatient: What does that mean for me, Doctor?\n\nDoctor:  Based  on  the  imaging,  we  suspect  an  atypical  case  of  Hepatocellular  Carcinoma  (HCC),\n\npossibly  related  to  cholangiocarcinoma  or  metastasis.  We're  awaiting  the  final  radiological  opinion\n\nbefore finalizing your treatment plan.\n\nPatient: I see. What about my lab results?\n\nDoctor: Your recent labs show that your hemoglobin is 12.9, which is normal. Your white blood cell\n\ncount is also within the normal range at 5.21. Platelets are slightly higher at 324, and your bilirubin\n\nlevels are within the normal range, with a total bilirubin of 0.32 and direct bilirubin of 0.2. Your liver\n\nenzymes, ALT and AST, are normal, and your alkaline phosphatase has increased slightly to 113.\n\nYour albumin is at 4.04, which is good, and your creatinine is low at 0.47. Electrolytes like sodium\n\nand potassium are normal. Your AFP is still elevated at 26.5, and PIVKA II is quite high at 3844. CA\n\n19-9 is elevated at 60.7, but CEA is normal at 0.97.\n\nPatient: So, my AFP and PIVKA II are high. Does that mean the cancer is active?\n\nDoctor: Elevated AFP and PIVKA II can be associated with liver cancer, which is why well need to\n\nmonitor  these  levels  closely.  Based  on  your  Child-Pugh  score  of  A5  and  your  MELD  score  of  9,\n\nyoure in a better condition than others with more advanced cirrhosis. We will have a clear plan once\n\nwe receive the full report from the radiologist.\n\n\fPatient: What happens next?\n\nDoctor: We will stop Levatinib for now, as it may be contributing to your symptoms. Well follow up\n\nafter your CT report is reviewed by the radiologist. Then, well discuss the next steps based on that\n\nopinion.\n\nPatient: Alright, Doctor. Ill wait for the report and follow your guidance.\n\nDoctor:  Thank  you,  Shamim.  We  will  keep  monitoring  your  condition  closely  and  ensure  youre\n\ngetting the best possible care.                                                                                                          \n\nPatient:  Doctor,  I  came  for  my  follow-up  visit.  Im  still  feeling  some  pain,  especially  around  the\n\nincision site. It comes and goes, and I also have this burning sensation in my hands and feet.\n\nDoctor: I understand. Lets go over everything. First, how are things in general since your surgery on\n\nOctober 31st? You were discharged on November 5th, and its been a little over two months since\n\nthen.\n\nPatient: Yes, it's been a while. Ive had some issues like a bit of pain near the incision, but nothing\n\ntoo severe.\n\nDoctor: Thats expected during the recovery process, but well monitor it. Ill also take a look at your\n\nhistopathology  report  from  the  surgery.  It  shows  that  the  mass  removed  from  your  liver  was  an\n\nexophytic  mass,  moderately  to  poorly  differentiated  hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC),  10.5  cm  in\n\nsize.  It  had  necrosis  present,  and  the  tumor  was  very  close  to  the  liver  margin,  but  there  was  no\n\nmicrovascular invasion.\n\n\fPatient: So, what does that mean for me, Doctor? Is the cancer gone now?\n\nDoctor: The fact that we removed the tumor is good news. However, you still have liver cirrhosis with\n\nchronic hepatitis and steatosis in the background. The gallbladder also showed chronic cholecystitis,\n\nbut theres no malignancy in the gallbladder.\n\nPatient: What about my liver? Whats next for me now?\n\nDoctor:  We  need  to  keep  monitoring  your  liver  closely,  especially  since  you  have  cirrhosis.  Your\n\nlatest ultrasound from November 12th showed some mild ascites, which is common in cirrhosis, and\n\nthere was no pleural effusion. We also found a small collection in the gallbladder fossa, which well\n\nkeep an eye on.\n\nPatient: Okay. How about my blood results? Are there any changes?\n\nDoctor:  Lets  go  over  them.  Your  hemoglobin  level  went  from  12.4  g/dL  in  August  to  11.1  g/dL  in\n\nNovember, and now its back up to 12.6 g/dL. Your white blood cell count has increased from 4.9 to\n\n6.04,  which  is  still  within  normal  range.  Platelets  have  dropped  from  324  to  171,  which  we  will\n\nmonitor.  Your  liver  function  tests,  like  ALT  and  AST,  are  normal,  but  your  bilirubin  level  has\n\nincreased slightly to 0.38 in January from 0.32 in October. Your albumin levels dropped a little but\n\nare still acceptable at 3.73 g/dL.\n\nPatient: That doesnt sound too bad, right? What does this mean for my treatment?\n\nDoctor: Overall, its a mixed picture. Your liver function is stable, which is good. However, since your\n\nHCC was moderate to poorly differentiated, we need to start you on Sorafenib, 200 mg twice daily.\n\nIts an oral chemotherapy drug that can help slow the growth of cancer. We need to be aware of side\n\n\feffects, which I will explain to you.\n\nPatient: What should I expect from the treatment? How long will I need to take Sorafenib?\n\nDoctor:  Youll  need  to  take  Sorafenib  for  an  extended  period,  but  well  monitor  you  closely.  If  your\n\nliver starts to fail within the next 8 months or if new tumors form or spread outside the liver, we may\n\nconsider  a  liver  transplant.  However,  if  your  liver  stays  stable,  and  theres  no  tumor  growth  or\n\nmetastasis,  we  can  continue  with  the  medical  management.  If  we  see  that  the  tumor  is\n\nangioinvasive or has spread outside the liver, chemotherapy would be the next step.\n\nPatient: That sounds complicated. Will I be okay?\n\nDoctor: We will continue to monitor your condition carefully, and well adjust treatment as necessary.\n\nWell do another follow-up in about 4 months, where well check your lab results, AFP levels, and an\n\nupdated CT scan. I also want to make sure youre feeling okay on Sorafenib, so well check for side\n\neffects closely.\n\nPatient:  Alright,  Doctor.  Thank  you  for  explaining  everything.  Ill  keep  up  with  the  medications  and\n\nfollow-up appointments.\n\nDoctor: Youre welcome. Keep me updated if you notice any changes or new symptoms. Take care,\n\nand well see you in 4 months.\n\n\f\f",

How are you today?\n\nPatient: I'm doing fine, thank you!\n\nDoctor:  Great  to  hear!  So,  today  well  be  discussing  your  potential  role  as  a  liver  donor.  Can  you\n\nconfirm that you're considering donating part of your liver to your father?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's correct. I am considering donating part of my liver to my father.\n\nDoctor:  Alright.  I  see  that  you're  18  years  old,  an  intermediate  student  from  Samanabad,  and  you\n\nare currently single. Just to confirm, your fathers recipient MRN is 761922, and his blood group is\n\nB+ve, is that right?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\n\nDoctor:  Your  blood  group  is  also  compatible,  and  your  fathers  indication  for  the  transplant  is\n\ncryptogenic/NASH DCLD. The CTP score for your father is B8, and his MELD score is 23.\n\nPatient: Yes, thats all right.\n\nDoctor: Okay, so there are no active complaints or symptoms at the moment. Youve had no history\n\nof  blood  transfusions,  fevers,  or  night  sweats.  Your  prior  medical  and  surgical  history  are\n\n\funremarkable, and you have no allergies, correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\n\nDoctor:  Moving  on  to  your  socio-economic  background,  it  appears  you  do  not  have  any  religious,\n\ncultural, or spiritual needs for your care. You mentioned you are currently unemployed, single, and\n\nhave no addictions, including smoking, alcohol, or tobacco use.\n\nPatient: Yes, thats all accurate.\n\nDoctor:  Youve  never  been  on  any  current  medications,  nor  do  you  have  any  past  history  of\n\nmedications. And your family history is also unremarkable.\n\nPatient: Correct.\n\nDoctor: Now, for the psychological screening, I see that you have no history of depression, suicidal\n\nthoughts, or self-harm attempts. Thats good to hear. Is that still accurate?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's accurate.\n\nDoctor:  Regarding  any  religious  or  cultural  practices,  theres  nothing  specific  you  need  to  consider\n\nfor your care, is that right?\n\nPatient: Yes, thats right.\n\nDoctor:  As  for  physical  or  cognitive  limitations,  it  seems  there  are  none.  You  have  no  issues  with\n\nlanguage, speech, vision, cognition, or mobility.\n\n\fPatient: Yes, no issues there.\n\nDoctor:  Now,  during  your  physical  examination,  I  found  your  abdomen  to  be  soft,  non-tender,  and\n\nnon-distended.  Your  lungs  had  normal  vesicular  breathing,  and  your  heart  sounds  were  normal\n\nwithout murmurs. You were conscious, well-oriented, and had a GCS of 15/15. All seems to be in\n\norder.\n\nPatient: Yes, everything sounds normal.\n\nDoctor:  Great!  Lets  review  your  vital  signs.  Your  blood  pressure  is  120/78,  heart  rate  is  71,\n\ntemperature is 36.9\u00b0C, and your oxygen saturation is 97%. Your height is 154 cm, weight is 58 kg,\n\nand your BMI is 26.9.\n\nPatient: Okay, that seems accurate.\n\nDoctor: Now, let me explain the risks associated with being a liver donor. The mortality risk is very\n\nlow,  around  0.5%,  which  means  theres  1  in  200  chance.  However,  the  morbidity  risk  is  higher,  at\n\nabout  15-20%.  This  could  include  complications  like  liver  failure,  deep  vein  thrombosis  (DVT),\n\npulmonary embolism (PE), pneumonia, incisional hernia, biliary leaks, or strictures. Some of these\n\nmay  require  endoscopic,  radiological,  or  surgical  interventions.  As  part  of  the  hepatectomy\n\nprocedure, we will also be performing a cholecystectomy. These risks have been explained to you,\n\nand you understand them, correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, I understand the risks.\n\nDoctor:  Excellent.  I  also  see  that  you  have  been  educated  about  living  donor  liver  transplantation\n\n\f(LDLT), and you are fully aware of the procedure and its associated risks. We can proceed to the\n\nnext step. Is that alright with you?\n\nPatient: Yes, I'm ready to proceed.\n\nDoctor:  Moving  on  to  the  psychiatry  evaluation  now,  I  see  you're  a  student,  third  among  four\n\nsiblings, and living in Lahore. You have denied any history of recent illness, past medical or surgical\n\nhistory, and have no psychiatric conditions or medication history. You also denied any addiction.\n\nPatient: Thats correct.\n\nDoctor:  Youve  also  confirmed  that  theres  no  coercion  in  your  decision,  and  you  are  aware  of  the\n\ntransplant  process,  its  risks,  and  complications.  You  have  adequate  support  for  the  process,  and\n\nthere are no financial concerns at the moment, correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, thats all true.\n\nDoctor: Regarding suicide risk, Ive asked you about any suicidal thoughts or intentions, and youve\n\nconfirmed there are none. Your response to the C-SSRS (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale)\n\nshows no suicidal behavior or risk. Therefore, your risk level is considered to be zero.\n\nPatient: Yes, I am not at risk.\n\nDoctor:  Thats  good  to  hear.  Based  on  my  assessment,  I  believe  you  have  the  decision-making\n\ncapacity  and  the  necessary  support  for  this  donation.  There  are  no  concerns  from  the  psychiatric\n\nside.\n\n\fPatient: Thank you, Doctor.\n\nDoctor: You're welcome! Well proceed with the next steps and keep monitoring your progress. If you\n\nhave any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out.\n\nPatient: Thank you! I feel confident moving forward.\n\n\f",

    "raw_text": "Gender: Male\n\nAge: 59\n\nMRN: 813351\n\nDiagnosis: Cholangiocarcinoma\n\nHistory and Physical:\n\nPatient: Doctor, I've been having severe abdominal pain, extreme itching, difficulty sleeping, fatigue,\n\nand significant weight loss over the last three weeks.\n\nDoctor: I understand. Can you tell me more about when the pain started?\n\nPatient: It began suddenly three weeks ago. The pain has been constant, and there's nothing that\n\nseems to make it better or worse.\n\nDoctor: Along with the pain, you mentioned extreme itching and difficulty sleeping. Is the itching all\n\nover your body?\n\nPatient: Yes, it's been all over, and its making it hard to sleep.\n\nDoctor: Its also affecting your energy levels, I see. You mentioned feeling fatigued and sleepy during\n\nthe day?\n\nPatient: Yes, I feel very tired all the time, and I struggle to stay awake during the day. I also lost 7\n\nkgs in just two weeks.\n\nDoctor: I see. Well need to investigate this further. Ill look at your lab results, starting with your viral\n\nmarkers.  Your  HCV  and  HBV  tests  from  August  15th  were  negative,  which  is  good.  Youve  had\n\ntreatment with interferon and DAA in the past and have achieved a sustained virologic response.\n\n\fPatient: Yes, that's right. But these symptoms are still bothering me.\n\nDoctor: Well definitely look into this more. Let's review some other aspects. Im noting that youve had\n\njaundice for about a month, but no hematemesis, melena, or ascites. No blood transfusions either.\n\nHave you had any fevers or night sweats?\n\nPatient: No, no fevers or night sweats.\n\nDoctor: Your history of diabetes is also important to note, and I see that youve had no surgeries in\n\nthe past. Are you taking any medications?\n\nPatient: Yes, Im on several medications. I take esomeprazole 40mg once a day, levijon three times\n\na day, rifaximin once a day, ursodeoxycholic acid twice daily, ertugliflozin-sitagliptin twice a day, and\n\nphloroglunicol in case of pain.\n\nDoctor: Okay, Ill make a note of all that. Now, your family history is significant. Your mother passed\n\naway from liver cancer, and your father from kidney-related issues. Your sister has diabetes.\n\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\n\nDoctor:  Now,  let's  talk  about  the  results  of  your  recent  investigations.  The  ultrasound  from  August\n\n26th  showed  an  enlarged  fatty  liver  with  grade  I  dilatation  of  the  intrahepatic  biliary  duct.  The  CT\n\nscan  from  September  2nd  revealed  an  ill-defined  mass  at  the  bifurcation  of  the  common  hepatic\n\nduct, which is causing moderate dilatation in the intrahepatic biliary ducts.\n\nPatient: That doesnt sound good, Doctor.\n\n\fDoctor: You're right. The CT scan from PKLI on September 11th showed a soft tissue mass at the\n\nconfluence  of  the  hepatic  ducts,  measuring  about  2  x  1.5  cm.  This  mass  is  causing  mild  biliary\n\ndilatation and is affecting both the right hepatic artery and narrowing the left portal vein. Theres no\n\nevidence of cirrhosis, but the biliary system is impacted.\n\nPatient: Im worried about what this could mean for me.\n\nDoctor: I understand your concern. Based on these findings and your symptoms, I suspect you may\n\nhave  a  Klatskin  tumor.  Well  need  more  detailed  imaging  and  tests  to  confirm  this,  but  this  is  a\n\npossibility.\n\nPatient: Whats the next step?\n\nDoctor:  Well  schedule  a  CT  scan  with  the  HCC  protocol  to  assess  the  tumors  morphology  and  to\n\nhelp us decide on the best course of treatment. Surgery could be an option, but we'll need to gather\n\nmore information first.\n\nPatient: What are the risks of surgery?\n\nDoctor: Surgery carries a 3-4% risk of mortality and a 10% risk of morbidity. However, the five-year\n\nsurvival rate for patients with this condition post-surgery is about 40%. Its important to weigh these\n\nrisks, but surgery is a potential treatment.\n\nPatient: I understand. What else do I need to do in the meantime?\n\nDoctor: Youll need to continue with your current medications and focus on improving your physical\n\n\factivity and controlling your blood sugar levels. Well also schedule an ERCP to assess the bile duct\n\nfurther.\n\nPatient: Okay, thank you for explaining all of this.\n\nDoctor: Youre welcome. Well keep monitoring your condition closely. After the CT scan and further\n\ntests,  well  determine  the  next  steps.  Dont  hesitate  to  reach  out  if  you  have  any  questions  in  the\n\nmeantime.\n\nPatient: I will. Thank you, Doctor.\n\nFollow-Up Visit (September 16, 2024)\n\nDoctor: How have you been feeling since your last visit?\n\nPatient: The pain is still there, and Im still experiencing the itching and fatigue.\n\nDoctor:  We  will  continue  monitoring  these  symptoms  closely.  Your  lab  results  are  showing  an\n\nincrease  in  your  bilirubin  levels,  which  could  be  indicative  of  worsening  biliary  obstruction.  Your\n\nrecent  CT  scan  didnt  show  any  major  changes,  but  it  confirmed  the  mass  and  its  effects  on  the\n\nbiliary system.\n\nPatient: Whats the next step?\n\nDoctor:  I  will  consult  with  the  multidisciplinary  team  to  discuss  possible  surgery  options.  Well  also\n\nperform an ERCP to evaluate the bile ducts more thoroughly. Its crucial we understand the extent of\n\nthe biliary stricture.\n\n\fPatient: Okay, Doctor. What about my other medications?\n\nDoctor: Keep taking your current medications as prescribed. We might need to adjust them based\n\non the results of further tests.\n\nPatient: Thank you for your care.\n\nDoctor:  You're  welcome.  We'll  proceed  with  the  treatment  plan  and  follow  up  with  you  after  the\n\nERCP and additional tests.\n\nFollow-Up Visit (October 23, 2024)\n\nDoctor: How have things been since your last visit?\n\nPatient: My pedal edema has gotten worse in the last two weeks, and Ive had some swelling in my\n\nlegs.\n\nDoctor:  I  see.  Let's  review  your  imaging  and  lab  results.  The  ERCP  you  had  on  October  4th\n\nrevealed  a  stricture  in  the  bile  duct,  and  we  obtained  a  biopsy  from  it.  The  biopsy  suggests\n\ncholangiocarcinoma, which is consistent with the initial diagnosis of a Klatskin tumor.\n\nPatient: What does this mean for me?\n\nDoctor:  Well  need  to  discuss  surgical  options  in  more  detail,  particularly  the  left  hepatectomy  and\n\nbile duct excision. This will be followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. The surgery carries some risks,\n\nbut it's important to proceed with the treatment.\n\n\fPatient: I understand. What should I expect next?\n\nDoctor:  The  multidisciplinary  team  will  meet  to  finalize  the  treatment  plan.  We'll  also  continue\n\nmonitoring  your  liver  function  through  labs  and  imaging.  Lets  keep  focused  on  improving  your\n\nphysical activity and managing your blood sugar.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your guidance.\n\nDoctor: Of course, were here for you every step of the way.\n\n\f",

I have been having issues with jaundice, and I wanted to follow up. My family history is\n\nclear, no chronic diseases, cancers, or genetic conditions run in the family.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThank you for sharing. Can you tell me a bit about your social and occupational history?\n\nPatient:\n\nSure. I work as a property dealer. I do consume tobacco and have been using pan for the last 20\n\nyears. I don't smoke, but I do drink alcohol occasionally, especially during weddings and events. My\n\nalcohol  consumption  was  more  frequent  up  until  2007,  when  I  used  to  have  about  750ml  in  one\n\nsitting, around three times a week.\n\nDoctor:\n\nGot it. Now, let me check on your physical exam. Based on the exam, your consciousness level is\n\nnormal,  and  you  are  well-oriented  with  a  GCS  of  15/15.  Your  heart  sounds  are  normal,  and  your\n\nabdomen is soft and non-tender with no distension. I have also reviewed your CT scan. The report\n\nshows  that  your  left  lobe  liver  is  affected  with  intrahepatic  cholangiocarcinoma,  extending  into  the\n\ncommon  bile  duct.  The  viral  markers  are  negative,  and  there  are  no  other  liver  decompensations\n\nexcept for the jaundice.\n\nPatient:\n\n\fYes, doctor, thats what Ive been experiencing. I understand the diagnosis, but whats the next step?\n\nDoctor:\n\nIm recommending an ERCP with metallic stent placement, along with brushings, as your condition is\n\nnot ideal for curative surgery due to the cirrhosis seen on your Fibroscan. The biopsy of the left lobe\n\nliver lesion will also be done. Im referring you to oncology for chemotherapy.\n\nPatient:\n\nThank you, doctor. What did the recent imaging say?\n\nDoctor:\n\nThe CT scan from 31st October 2023 shows a mass in your left lobe, about 8.4 x 7.3 cm in size. Its\n\nextending  into  both  the  left  hepatic  duct  and  common  hepatic  duct,  causing  moderate  intrahepatic\n\nbiliary  dilatation.  The  left  hepatic  artery  and  portal  veins  are  involved,  but  theres  no  extrahepatic\n\ndisease right now. The right side is clear. I also looked at your latest FibroScan from 15th November\n\n2023, which showed cirrhosis and severe steatosis.\n\nPatient:\n\nOkay, I see. What about the biopsy?\n\nDoctor:\n\nThe  biopsy  on  11th  December  2023  confirmed  poorly  differentiated  adenocarcinoma  of  the  liver.\n\nThe \n\nimmunohistochemistry  showed  positive  staining \n\nfor  CK7  and  CK19, \n\nindicating  a\n\npancreaticobiliary origin. Clinical and radiologic correlation is advised to understand the extent more\n\nclearly.\n\nPatient:\n\n\fUnderstood, doctor. How are my lab results looking?\n\nDoctor:\n\nHere are the key lab results from your tests:\n\nHemoglobin is stable at 13.1 g/dL.\n\nYour total white blood cell count (TLC) has dropped a bit, from 6.4 to 4.7, indicating a mild reduction.\n\nPlatelet count dropped from 719 to 227, which is notable but not critical at the moment.\n\nBilirubin levels are high, especially the total bilirubin at 20 on 6th November, which dropped to 4.3 by\n\n17th December.\n\nLiver enzymes like ALT and AST are slightly elevated, but not alarmingly so.\n\nYour albumin level is still on the lower side at 3.5, which is typical in liver disease.\n\nINR, a measure of clotting, is high at 1.86.\n\nPatient:\n\nIt seems like my liver function is quite compromised. Whats the next step?\n\nDoctor:\n\nYou are correct, and this confirms the need for close monitoring. After the ERCP and biopsy, we will\n\nproceed  with  chemotherapy,  and  Ive  referred  you  to  the  oncology  team  for  further  management.  I\n\nwill also need you to repeat fresh labs and a CT scan in two weeks to assess the current status.\n\n\fPatient:\n\nOkay, I understand. Hows my treatment progressing overall?\n\nDoctor:\n\nYouve  been  progressing  well  post-ERCP.  Your  liver  function  tests  (LFTs)  are  improving,  and\n\nclinically, youre showing some improvement. The chemotherapy from Farooq Hospital is underway,\n\nand we will continue to monitor the progress.\n\nPatient:\n\nGreat. I also had some abdominal pain and jaundice recently. Should I be concerned?\n\nDoctor:\n\nThe  pain  and  jaundice  are  common  symptoms  with  this  condition,  especially  with  obstructive\n\njaundice.  Well  need  to  keep  track  of  these  symptoms  during  your  treatment,  and  its  important  to\n\nfollow up with the oncology team for any adjustments to your chemotherapy.\n\nPatient:\n\nThank you for the thorough explanation, doctor. Ill make sure to follow your recommendations.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYou're  welcome.  We  will  keep  monitoring  your  condition  closely.  Please  ensure  to  follow  up  as\n\nscheduled, and if any new symptoms arise, let us know immediately.\n\n\f",

Lets  go  through  your  history.  You  were  diagnosed  with  Hepatitis  C  about  a\n\nmonth ago, correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, thats right. I havent received any treatment for it yet.\n\nDoctor:  Alright,  so  youve  been  having  some  pain  in  the  epigastric  region  for  about  a  month.  How\n\nhas your general health been apart from that?\n\nPatient:  Ive  lost  some  weight,  and  I  do  have  jaundice.  But  I  havent  had  any  blood  transfusions  or\n\nany issues like melena or fever.\n\nDoctor:  Understood.  You  mentioned  no  history  of  bleeding,  ascites,  or  encephalopathy,  which  is\n\ngood. Now, can you tell me about any past medical or surgical history?\n\nPatient: No significant history, doctor. I havent had any surgeries before, and Im not allergic to any\n\nmedications.\n\nDoctor: Great, thats helpful to know. Regarding your lifestyle, I see that youve been a smoker for 30\n\n\fyears with a 40-pack year history. Do you still smoke?\n\nPatient: Yes, I still smoke.\n\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. Now, in terms of your physical exam, I noticed that you have a\n\nmass in the epigastric region, about 5x5 cm, which moves with respiration. Your liver edge is also\n\npalpable 7 cm below the costal margin.\n\nPatient: Yes, I can feel some discomfort in that area.\n\nDoctor: I see. Based on your ultrasound on 1st August, you have a coarse liver and a mass in the\n\nleft  lobe.  The  CT  scan  on  3rd  August  confirmed  liver  cirrhosis  with  a  hepatocellular  carcinoma\n\n(HCC) of 5.5x3.6 cm. The mass had wash-out characteristics, which are suggestive of HCC.\n\nPatient: Oh, that sounds serious.\n\nDoctor: Yes, it is. We need to act quickly. Your lab results from 2nd August show your hemoglobin at\n\n13.6,  white  blood  cells  at  9.4,  platelets  at  111,  and  bilirubin  levels  at  0.8.  Your  liver  enzymes  are\n\nelevated, with ALT at 84 and AST at 85. However, your AFP level is relatively low at 10.8. The CTP\n\nscore is A5, indicating a more advanced state of cirrhosis.\n\nPatient: What does all this mean for me, doctor?\n\nDoctor: The HCV infection has led to liver cirrhosis, which has progressed to HCC. Your condition is\n\nbeing  managed  through  a  multidisciplinary  team  approach.  For  now,  we  are  considering\n\nlaparoscopic or robotic left lateral hepatectomy to remove the tumor.\n\n\fPatient: Whats the next step?\n\nDoctor: We will need to bring a CD for further reporting. Ill also refer you to the hepatology team for\n\ntreatment  of  your  Hepatitis  C.  We  will  discuss  this  further  in  an  MDT  (Multidisciplinary  Team)\n\nmeeting.\n\nPatient: Okay, doctor, I understand.\n\nDoctor: Now, we saw you again on 26th August for anesthesia fitness, and everything was cleared\n\nfor the surgery. We planned for a robotic left lateral hepatectomy.\n\nPatient: And I had that surgery on 24th September, correct?\n\nDoctor:  Yes,  your  surgery  went  smoothly.  One  month  post-operation,  I  see  you're  recovering  well.\n\nThe  histopathology  report  from  2nd  October  shows  that  the  tumor  was  a  well-differentiated  HCC,\n\nsolitary,  measuring  5.2  cm.  There's  no  vascular  invasion,  and  the  liver  margin  is  clear.  The\n\nbackground liver tissue shows chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis.\n\nPatient: So, the surgery seems to have been successful?\n\nDoctor:  Yes,  it  looks  promising.  Your  liver  margin  was  clear,  and  the  tumor  was  contained.  Were\n\nmonitoring your recovery closely. Youve been prescribed paracetamol for pain and omeprazole for\n\nany stomach acid issues. I encourage you to mobilize and stay active as much as possible.\n\nPatient: Ive been feeling better, but the pain is still there, especially near the scar.\n\nDoctor:  Thats  normal.  The  healing  process  takes  time.  Just  make  sure  to  follow  the  prescribed\n\n\fmedications. I also see that you're on Sofosbuvir and Velpatasvir for your Hepatitis C, starting 1st\n\nOctober, along with a multivitamin and Metformin. Well continue with these medications.\n\nPatient: Yes, Ive been taking them as prescribed.\n\nDoctor: Good. Your next follow-up will include a CT triphasic liver scan, AFP levels, and lab tests for\n\nyour Child-Pugh score and MELD score. After that, well check in again after a week.\n\nPatient: That sounds good, doctor. Thank you for the care.\n\nDoctor: You're welcome. Well keep monitoring you closely. Let us know if any issues arise, and well\n\nensure you're taken care of.\n\nFollow-up on 13th December:\n\nDoctor: Hello, how have you been feeling today?\n\nPatient: Im still having some pain in my abdomen, doctor.\n\nDoctor:  Let  me  review  your  history.  You  had  the  robotic  left  lateral  hepatectomy  in  September  for\n\nHepatitis C-related HCC, and youre still on the same medications.\n\nPatient: Yes, thats correct. The pain hasnt completely gone away.\n\nDoctor: On examination, you look healthy overall, and your abdomen is soft and non-tender, with a\n\nhealthy  scar  from  the  surgery.  Weve  prescribed  Sofosbuvir-Velpatasvir,  multivitamins,  and\n\nMetformin, which youre continuing.\n\n\fPatient: Yes, Im taking everything as prescribed.\n\nDoctor: Well need to proceed with a CT triphasic liver scan, AFP levels, and check your lab results\n\nfor the Child-Pugh and MELD scores. After that, well follow up with you in a week.\n\nPatient: Alright, Ill come in for the tests.\n\nDoctor: Perfect, well stay in touch. Let us know if any concerns arise in the meantime.\n\n\f",

Its been concerning.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI  understand.  Let  me  go  over  your  medical  history  and  current  condition.  You  have  a  history  of\n\ndiabetes, hypertension, and youve also had acute bacterial meningitis in the past, where you were\n\nadmitted to the ICU. You're also dealing with jaundice, cough, and a history of fever, for which youre\n\non IV antibiotics.\n\nWeve reviewed your recent CT scan, and it shows a large hepatic mass in the right lobe of the liver,\n\nwhich  appears  to  be  a  malignant  mass.  There  is  also  a  thrombosis  in  the  posterior  division  of  the\n\nright  portal  vein.  The  biopsy  results  suggest  that  it  could  be  a  poorly  differentiated  hepatocellular\n\ncarcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma, or a metastatic disease.\n\nPatient:\n\nThat sounds serious. What about the lab results?\n\nDoctor:\n\nHere are your latest lab results from January 15, 2025:\n\nTotal Bilirubin: 10.6\n\n\fAlkaline Phosphatase (ALP): 684\n\nAlbumin: 2.87\n\nINR: 1.1\n\nPlatelets: 493\n\nHemoglobin: 10.2\n\nAFP (Alpha-Fetoprotein): 540\n\nViral markers: Negative\n\nALT: 40\n\nThese  results  confirm  some  issues  with  your  liver  function,  and  were  monitoring  closely  for  any\n\nfurther changes.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhats the plan going forward?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWere  referring  you  to  the  gastroenterology  outpatient  department  today.  Ive  discussed  your  case\n\nwith  Dr.  Usman  Aujla,  and  were  preparing  for  an  ERCP  to  address  any  biliary  obstructions.  Weve\n\nalso  planned  for  an  HRCT  and  an  anesthesia  evaluation.  Well  continue  with  the  meropenem  for\n\nnow, along with Ursodeoxycholic acid for bile flow.\n\n\fPatient:\n\nI see. How will the ERCP help?\n\nDoctor:\n\nThe  ERCP  will  help  assess  the  biliary  system  and  check  if  there  are  any  blockages.  If  necessary,\n\nwell place a stent to help with bile drainage. We have explained the risks of the procedure to your\n\ndaughter, including potential complications like bleeding, perforation, and infection.\n\nFollow-Up Visit on February 10, 2025\n\nDoctor:\n\nYoure back for a follow-up. How have you been feeling?\n\nPatient:\n\nIm still having abdominal pain, fever, and a loss of appetite.\n\nDoctor:\n\nWe reviewed your CT scan from January 24, 2025. It shows a large mass in segments VII, VIII, V,\n\nand VI, likely representing HCC, but theres a possibility of a mixed hepatocholangiocarcinoma. The\n\nliver surface is slightly undulating, but theres no sign of ascites or significant collateralization.\n\nYour bilirubin levels are still elevated:\n\nTotal Bilirubin: 9.2\n\nDirect Bilirubin: 8\n\n\fALT/AST: 31/125\n\nALP: 1743\n\nAlbumin: 2.6\n\nTheres no significant improvement in your jaundice despite the ERCP. Well rebook you for another\n\nERCP to assess and possibly change the stent.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhat about the pain and fever?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWell manage your pain with Panadol, and I recommend continuing with the current antibiotics. The\n\nfever should subside once we get better control over your biliary system.\n\nFollow-Up Visit on March 4, 2025\n\nDoctor:\n\nLets review your latest results. We noticed that theres no significant improvement in your jaundice,\n\neven after the two ERCP procedures. Were still seeing the liver mass and thrombosis. The bilirubin\n\nlevel remains elevated.\n\nHeres the comparison of the lab results from February 27 and March 4, 2025:\n\nTotal Bilirubin: 9.2  11.91\n\n\fDirect Bilirubin: 8\n\nALT/AST: 31/125  22\n\nALP: 1743  582\n\nAlbumin: 2.6  2.1\n\nPatient:\n\nThats worrying. Whats next?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWeve  discussed  your  case  with  the  multidisciplinary  team.  We  plan  to  repeat  imaging  with  a  CT\n\ntriphasic to better understand the disease extension and biliary invasion. Well follow up after a week.\n\nWe also recommend considering an IR-guided biopsy if there's no improvement in your bilirubin.\n\nFollow-Up Visit on March 18, 2025\n\nDoctor:\n\nThe multidisciplinary team has reviewed your case again. Your liver mass remains stable, with no\n\nsignificant change since the last evaluation. Theres some mild ascites and a few stable nodules in\n\nyour left lung. Theres also a new nodule in the right basal segment, which well need to follow up.\n\nWell  continue  monitoring  the  liver  lesion  closely.  If  the  bilirubin  doesnt  improve,  we  may  consider\n\nanother ERCP or an IR-guided biopsy of the liver lesion.\n\n\fPatient:\n\nWhats the current treatment plan?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWere  continuing  your  Ursodeoxycholic  acid  and  antibiotics.  Ive  prescribed  Lasix  to  help  with  fluid\n\nretention. Well continue monitoring your appetite and overall health.\n\nHepatology Visit on March 25, 2025\n\nDoctor (to daughter):\n\nI see your fathers condition remains concerning, with a total bilirubin of 13 mg/dL. His performance\n\nstatus is poor, and were working on adjusting his medications.\n\nWeve  reviewed  the  CT  scan,  and  the  liver  mass  still  appears  large,  but  stable.  Weve  planned  the\n\nfollowing:\n\nUrsodeoxycholic acid 500mg twice a day\n\nCiprofloxacin for 7 days\n\nFollow-up LFTs in two weeks\n\nWe'll keep monitoring his condition closely.\n\n\f",

My symptoms are the same as before.\"\n\nDoctor:  \"Let's  go  over  the  CT  scan  findings  and  your  lab  results.  Your  CT  scan  from  October  3rd\n\nshows  moderate  intrahepatic  biliary  dilatation  due  to  an  enhancing  mass  lesion,  consistent  with  a\n\nBismuth  IIIb  classification.  The  lesion  is  at  the  confluence  of  the  right  and  left  hepatic  ducts,\n\nextending  proximally  and  distally  into  the  mid  CBD.  It  seems  the  segment  IV  hepatic  artery  is\n\npartially encased by the tumor. Theres also some hypodensity in the caudate lobe, and prominent\n\nabdominal lymphadenopathy, likely metastatic.\n\nYour lab results from September 10th are as follows:\n\nHemoglobin (HB): 11.3\n\nTotal Leukocyte Count (TLC): 15.7\n\nPlatelets: 165\n\nRandom Sugar: 9\n\nTotal Bilirubin (T.bili): 36.0\n\nALT: 134\n\n\fAST: 143\n\nALP: 1424\n\nAlbumin: 3.0\n\nUrea: 41\n\nCreatinine: 1.2\n\nSodium: 138\n\nPotassium: 3.52\n\nWere planning for an ERCP and biopsy.

The  symptoms\n\nhavent improved much.\"\n\n\fDoctor:  \"I  see.  The  ERCP  results  from  October  11th  show  a  normal-looking  ampulla,  and  we\n\nperformed a pancreatic papillotomy. We achieved cannulation of the common bile duct with a double\n\nguidewire technique and passed it into the left hepatic duct. A sphincterotomy was performed, and\n\nwe placed a 5 French 5 cm pancreatic stent. After this, we placed biliary stents in both the right and\n\nleft  hepatic  systems  with  excellent  drainage.  Histopathology  from  the  CBD  brushings  came  back\n\nnegative for malignant cells.\"\n\nPatient: \"What does that mean for my condition, doctor?\"\n\nDoctor: \"It means that while we didnt find malignant cells in the brushing, your cholangiocarcinoma\n\ndiagnosis  remains.  We  are  focusing  on  supportive  care  at  this  stage.  Your  liver  function  tests  and\n\nliver biopsy will help us assess the next steps.\"\n\nPlan:\n\nContinue with Ursodeoxycholic acid 250 mg TDS and Omeprazole 40 mg OD.\n\nBegin Cefixime 400 mg once daily for 7 days.\n\nFollow-up in one month.\n\nFollow-Up Visit 4 - 22/11/2024\n\nPatient: \"I've been feeling more pain, especially around the PTC drain site.

There's been\n\nsome  on-and-off  constipation,  and  I  had  a  fever  about  6-8  days  ago.  The  fever  reached  up  to\n\n101-102\u00b0F  but  has  been  gone  for  the  past  2-3  days.  Also,  I've  noticed  some  weight  loss,  but  I\n\nhaven't really been able to track it accurately.\n\nDoctor: I see. Let's go over your medical history. Do you have any chronic conditions?\n\nPatient:  Yes,  I  have  diabetes  and  hypertension,  but  no  history  of  hepatitis.  I  haven't  had  any\n\nsurgeries before either.\n\nDoctor: Got it. Ill take a look at your recent lab results. Here's what we have:\n\nPIVKA: 20\n\nAFP: 46.7\n\nPSA: 0.8 (normal)\n\nBilirubin: 1.3\n\n\fCreatinine: 0.9\n\nHemoglobin (Hgb): 13.3\n\nMCV: 83\n\nWBC: 11.3\n\nPlatelets (Plt): 247\n\nHbA1C: 6.8%\n\nPatient: Okay, what do these results indicate?\n\nDoctor:  Your  AFP  is  elevated,  which  is  concerning.  It's  associated  with  liver  issues,  like\n\nhepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC).  But  we  need  more  information.  Your  ultrasound  shows  a  solid\n\nmass measuring 6.2 cm by 6.2 cm, along with an enlarged prostate.\n\nPatient: What does this mean for me?\n\nDoctor:  We  need  to  confirm  whether  this  mass  is  an  abscess  or  potentially  cancer.  Your  CT  scan\n\nshows  a  7  x  6  cm  lesion  in  the  liver,  and  based  on  its  features,  we  are  concerned  about  evolving\n\nhepatic  abscess  versus  metastatic  deposits.  Well  discuss  this  at  the  MDT  (multidisciplinary  team)\n\nmeeting on Friday.\n\nPatient: Whats the plan moving forward?\n\n\fDoctor:  For  now,  well  submit  your  CD  for  review,  and  well  meet  again  on  Friday  after  the  MDT\n\ndiscussion to decide the next steps. Well consider further tests and potential treatments.\n\nDate: 07/08/2024\n\nPatient: I havent had any active complaints since my last visit. No fever, and the pain has also been\n\nmanageable.\n\nDoctor:  Thats  good  to  hear.  Lets  review  your  previous  scans  and  tests.  The  CT  scan  now  shows\n\nthat the lesion in your liver is likely an atypical HCC, with possible tumor thrombus in the portal vein.\n\nThe abscess is less likely. We should consider either TACE or systemic treatments. Ill refer you to\n\nIR for further evaluation.\n\nPatient: So, its still concerning?\n\nDoctor: Yes, but well proceed carefully. Well have another MDT discussion on Friday to determine if\n\nsurgical  resection  might  be  an  option,  along  with  chemotherapy  or  locoregional  therapy.  Well  also\n\ncheck your CA 19-9 levels for further clarity.\n\nDate: 20/08/2024\n\nPatient: What do the latest results show?\n\nDoctor: Weve got the results from your fibroscan and viral screening. Your HBsAg, Anti-HCV, and\n\nAnti-HIV  tests  all  came  back  non-reactive,  which  is  good.  Your  CA  19-9  is  normal  as  well.  The\n\nfibroscan  indicates  that  you  have  an  F0  stage  of  hepatic  fibrosis,  meaning  there's  no  significant\n\nfibrosis at this time. However, your tumor still requires further management.\n\n\fPatient: Whats the next step in treatment?\n\nDoctor:  Well  continue  with  the  plan  to  refer  you  for  a  non-anatomical  resection  or  posterior\n\nsectionectomy.  The  surgery  date  will  be  confirmed  soon.  Afterward,  we'll  begin  discussing\n\nchemotherapy or immunotherapy options based on the latest research.\n\nDate: 21/08/2024\n\nPatient: What did the latest review indicate?\n\nDoctor: Following the re-MDT discussion, we've decided to proceed with immunotherapy, given its\n\nhigher effectiveness, though it can be costly. Well review all available options closely and make sure\n\nyoure informed before moving forward.\n\nPatient: Thank you. Whats next?\n\nDoctor: Ill send you to meet with the oncology team to begin immunotherapy in the next two weeks.\n\nWell also have you follow up in the HPB clinic to monitor your progress.\n\nDate: 19/09/2024\n\nPatient: Im feeling some weakness and drowsiness post-surgery. I also noticed some bleeding from\n\nthe wound site. Should I be concerned?\n\nDoctor: Its important that we monitor this closely. The wound is healing well, but the bleeding and\n\nother symptoms like weakness will need to be evaluated. Well review your lab results:\n\n\fHb: 10.7\n\nWBC: 9.05\n\nPlatelets: 431\n\nTotal Bilirubin: 0.56\n\nDirect Bilirubin: 0.27\n\nALT/AST: 93/34\n\nAlbumin: 3.67\n\nCreatinine: 0.84\n\nAFP: 46.7 (same as previous)\n\nDoctor:  It  seems  like  your  liver  function  is  improving,  but  well  need  to  continue  monitoring  your\n\ncondition closely, especially after the wedge resection. The histopathology report indicates a grade\n\n3 tumor with vascular invasion. The oncology team will help determine the best course of treatment\n\nfrom here.\n\nDate: 16/10/2024\n\nPatient: Hows my recovery going?\n\n\fDoctor: Your recovery seems to be progressing well. Youre at day 36 post-surgery. The tumor was\n\npoorly differentiated, and there was vascular invasion present. However, there was no malignancy\n\nfound  in  the  lymph  nodes.  You  still  need  follow-up  care,  and  chemotherapy  or  immunotherapy  is\n\nrecommended for further treatment.\n\nPatient: What should I do next?\n\nDoctor:  Ill  have  you  continue  follow-up  visits,  and  we'll  proceed  with  the  treatment  plan  based  on\n\nyour histopathology report. Youll also need to follow up with oncology to discuss the next steps for\n\ntreatment.\n\n\f",

Ive been experiencing some pain in my right upper quadrant for\n\nthe past three weeks, along with a loss of appetite and trouble sleeping.\n\nDoctor:\n\nHello, Mukhtar. Lets review your history. I see that you've been diagnosed with Hepatitis C in 2001,\n\ntreated  with  interferon,  and  achieved  a  sustained  virologic  response  (SVR).  Unfortunately,  you\n\nrelapsed in 2015, but after treatment with DAAs, you achieved SVR again. Your last HCV PCR in\n\n2019 showed no detection of the virus.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, that's right. The pain in my right upper abdomen has been bothering me a lot lately. It started\n\nabout three weeks ago, and I also feel very tired and can't sleep well.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI understand. Let me quickly go through the investigations weve done so far. Your ultrasound from\n\nSeptember 2022 showed chronic liver disease (CLD) with a focal lesion in the left lobe of your liver.\n\nYour  CT  scan  in  June  2023  showed  a  large  hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC)  at  the  junction  of\n\nsegments 2 and 3, measuring about 7.5 x 4.5 x 5.5 cm. There were also some nodules in your lungs\n\nand a few cysts in your right kidney, but there were no signs of portal lesions.\n\nPatient:\n\n\fYes, I remember that CT scan. Is the tumor still growing?\n\nDoctor:\n\nThe tumor is quite large, and since it's near the portal vein, we need to monitor it closely. We also\n\nperformed a liver biopsy in July, which showed chronic hepatitis with focal bridging fibrosis, but no\n\nevidence  of  malignancy.  The  Metavir  score  showed  significant  activity  (A3/A3),  and  fibrosis  was\n\nscored at F2-3/F4.\n\nPatient:\n\nI see. So, what's the next step in my treatment?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWe  need  to  proceed  with  a  follow-up  CT  scan  and  AFP  test  in  the  next  few  weeks.  If  the  donor\n\nworkup for a liver transplant is completed before that, we can do the scan sooner to reassess the\n\ntumor. Based on the size and location of the tumor, its crucial to check for any changes. We are also\n\nworking on the donors evaluation.\n\nPatient:\n\nI understand. And in the meantime, what should I be doing?\n\nDoctor:\n\nYou should continue with the rehabilitation process, take your prescribed medications, and manage\n\nsymptoms as needed. Theres no decompensation of your liver function right now, which is a good\n\nsign.\n\nPatient:\n\nOkay, Ill keep up with everything youve mentioned. Thanks for explaining everything, Doctor.\n\n\fDoctor:\n\nYou're  welcome,  Mukhtar.  Remember,  youre  not  alone  in  this.  Were  here  to  support  you  through\n\nevery step. Lets plan the next steps carefully and keep monitoring your health.\n\nFollow-up Visit:\n\nDoctor:\n\nHow have you been feeling since your last visit?\n\nPatient:\n\nIm  still  having  the  same  symptomspain  in  my  right  upper  quadrant,  loss  of  appetite,  and  difficulty\n\nsleeping.\n\nDoctor:\n\nLet me review your latest lab results and check the updates. Your hemoglobin is slightly improved at\n\n10.6, but your white blood cell count has increased a bit to 9.3. Your platelets are elevated, which\n\nwell need to keep an eye on. Liver enzymes have improved, with ALT at 30 and AST at 20. Your\n\nalbumin levels are stable at 4.4, but your creatinine remains normal at 0.81. Your AFP is still low at\n\n0.2, and your MELD score is still 7 points, which indicates moderate liver dysfunction.\n\nPatient:\n\nIm relieved to hear the AFP is still low. Does this mean the tumor hasnt spread?\n\nDoctor:\n\nYes, its a positive sign for now, but well continue monitoring it closely. Based on the tumors location,\n\na repeat CT scan in a few weeks will help us evaluate its current state.\n\n\fPatient:\n\nWhats the next step in terms of treatment?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWell  proceed  with  the  donor  workup  for  a  potential  liver  transplant.  Well  also  continue  with  the\n\nrehabilitation, and symptomatic treatment as needed. A follow-up CT scan after 3 weeks is essential\n\nto reassess the tumor, and we will do the AFP test again at that time.\n\nPatient:\n\nThat sounds like a good plan. Thanks for the update, Doctor.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYoure welcome. Stay on top of your medications, and well keep moving forward with the treatment\n\nplan. Keep me updated on how you're feeling. Well see you for the next follow-up soon.\n\nDischarge Summary (4th August 2023):\n\nDoctor:\n\nMukhtar,  you  were  admitted  for  TACE  (Transarterial  Chemoembolization)  on  August  3rd  for  the\n\nHCC in segments 2 and 3. The procedure went smoothly, and you tolerated it well. There were no\n\nimmediate complications, and youre stable for discharge today.\n\nPatient:\n\nI feel much better. What medications will I need to take?\n\nDoctor:\n\n\fYoull  continue  on  Omeprazole  for  the  next  two  weeks,  along  with  Cefixime  for  5  days.  If  you\n\nexperience any pain, you can take Tonflex-P. Ill also prescribe Lactulose to help with your digestive\n\nsymptoms, and Onset for any vomiting.\n\nPatient:\n\nGot it. When should I follow up?\n\nDoctor:\n\nYoull follow up in 3 weeks with a fresh CBC and LFT, and well plan another CT scan and AFP test\n\nafter 6 weeks to check for any changes in the tumor.\n\nPatient:\n\nThanks, Doctor. Ill make sure to follow the plan.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYou're welcome, Mukhtar. Stay in touch, and well see you soon.\n\n\f",

Let's  go  through  your  test\n\nresults.\n\nPatient: Yes, Doctor.\n\nDoctor: Your HCV PCR result came back as 17,900 IU/mL. That's detected, but we will monitor it.\n\nYour platelet count is 276, hemoglobin is 13.1, AST is 88, and ALT is 140. Your bilirubin, GGT, and\n\nALP are all within normal range, which is a good sign.\n\nPatient: That's a relief, Doctor. Is everything okay with my liver?\n\nDoctor:  There  is  an  issue  we  need  to  address.  Your  ultrasound  shows  a  SOL  (Space  Occupying\n\nLesion) in the left lobe of the liver. Based on that, we'll need to perform a triphasic CT scan and also\n\ncheck your serum AFP levels. This will help us further assess the situation.\n\nDate: 16-09-2024\n\nDoctor: The results from the triphasic CT scan are in. It shows an arterialized mass lesion in the left\n\nlobe of the liver, measuring 9.0 x 9.5 cm. There's no dilation of the intrahepatic biliary channels, and\n\nthe portal vein looks normal. No other significant findings.\n\n\fPatient: That sounds concerning, Doctor. What should I expect next?\n\nDoctor:  Don't  worry,  it's  just  a  step-by-step  process.  Your  serum  AFP  level  came  back  as  13.6\n\nIU/mL, which is normal. Based on the CT scan, we'll need to keep an eye on things and determine if\n\nwe need any further intervention.\n\nDate: 19-09-2024 (Initial Visit)\n\nDoctor:  I  see  you're  experiencing  some  abdominal  discomfort.  You  mentioned  that  you  found  out\n\nabout your HCV two months ago, but no treatment has been started yet?\n\nPatient: Yes, Doctor. I didnt take any treatment so far.\n\nDoctor: Understood. Lets also confirm that you have no comorbidities or significant medical history.\n\nYour weight and general health seem stable, and you dont have any allergies, weight loss, or history\n\nof other medical issues?\n\nPatient: No, Doctor, nothing like that.\n\nDoctor: Great, lets take a look at your recent labs. Your platelet count is 283, bilirubin is 0.61, ALT\n\nand  AST  are  112  and  60,  respectively,  and  your  albumin  level  is  4.23.  Everything  seems  stable\n\nexcept for the ALT and AST levels, which are a bit elevated. We also noticed that your AFP is still\n\n13.6 IU/mL, which is good.\n\nPatient: Is there anything I need to worry about regarding the liver mass?\n\n\fDoctor: We'll continue to monitor that closely. Ive scheduled a follow-up for next week. We will need\n\na triphasic CT scan and some baseline tests. I'll discuss the results with you during the follow-up.\n\nDate: 26-11-2024 (Follow-Up)\n\nDoctor: Welcome back. I see youve had another follow-up since we last met. How have you been\n\nfeeling?\n\nPatient: I feel okay, but I'm still concerned about my liver condition, Doctor.\n\nDoctor:  I  understand.  From  the  previous  scans,  we  know  that  you  have  an  angioinvasive\n\nhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The CT scan from 21/11/2024 shows a well-circumscribed mass of\n\n8.2  x  9.9  cm  in  the  left  hepatic  lobe  with  tumor  thrombosis  in  the  left  hepatic  vein.  There's  also\n\ncompression of the left portal vein, and we noticed additional changes in the segment IV-A HCC.\n\nPatient: This is scary, Doctor. What are the next steps?\n\nDoctor: Well continue with the plan for a left hepatectomy. I've referred your case to the HPB clinic\n\nfor  a  potential  surgery.  For  now,  well  monitor  your  liver  function  and  proceed  with  your  treatment\n\nplan.\n\nDate: 20-12-2024\n\nDoctor: How have you been feeling since our last appointment?\n\nPatient: Honestly, I dont have any symptoms, but the diagnosis is still on my mind.\n\n\fDoctor:  Youre  right  to  stay  informed.  The  good  news  is  that  you  havent  experienced  any\n\ndecompensations like jaundice, ascites, or bleeding. Your HCV was diagnosed 3 months ago, and\n\nyour  latest  HCV  PCR  was  197,000  IU/mL.  Youre  currently  HCV  treatment-naive,  meaning  you\n\nhaven't started any antiviral treatments yet.\n\nPatient: So, theres still time before we start treatment?\n\nDoctor: Yes, well start treatment soon, but right now, were focusing on the hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\nYou've not had any weight loss, blood transfusions, or fevers. Your family history is unremarkable,\n\nand you're not currently on any medications.\n\nDate: 24-12-2024\n\nDoctor:  Let's  go  over  your  latest  findings.  Your  CT  scan  from  21/11/2024  still  shows  the\n\nangioinvasive  HCC  in  the  left  hepatic  lobe.  Weve  discussed  your  case  in  an  MDT  meeting  on\n\n28/11/2024, and the plan is to proceed with a left hepatectomy.\n\nPatient: That sounds like a major surgery, Doctor. Should I be worried?\n\nDoctor: Its a significant procedure, but its the best option given the condition. We will monitor your\n\nliver function closely and adjust the plan as needed. Your liver function tests are stableyour AFP is\n\n13.6, bilirubin is normal, and your liver enzymes have shown some improvement.\n\nPatient: Will the surgery cure the cancer?\n\nDoctor: Surgery offers the best chance to control the cancer. Well continue to assess your overall\n\ncondition and take it step by step. We'll also keep your case in the MDT for further evaluation.\n\n\fDate: 29-12-2024\n\nDoctor:  Weve  discussed  your  condition  thoroughly  with  the  team.  We  will  proceed  with  the  left\n\nhepatectomy  plan  as  discussed.  The  team  will  also  monitor  your  blood  pressure  and  provide  the\n\nnecessary pre-surgical evaluations.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor. Ill follow all your instructions.\n\nDoctor: You're welcome. Well be in touch soon regarding the surgery and any further steps. Take\n\ncare, and well be here to support you throughout this journey.\n\n\f",

    "raw_text": "Gender: Female\n\nAge: 47\n\nMRN: 794991\n\nDiagnosis: Hepatocellular Carcinoma\n\nHistory and Physical:\n\nDoctor:\n\nHello, I see you're here for your follow-up. How have you been feeling recently?\n\nPatient:\n\nI've been having some intermittent fevers, along with abdominal pain, particularly in the upper right\n\nside. But, other than that, I don't have any major complaints at the moment.\n\nDoctor:\n\nI understand. Let's go through your recent tests. First, let me review your lab results. Your bilirubin\n\nlevel  is  at  1.34,  which  is  within  a  manageable  range.  Your  liver  enzymes  are  showing  a  slight\n\nimprovementALT  at  24,  AST  at  26,  and  ALP  at  233.  Your  albumin  is  3.22,  and  creatinine  is  0.77,\n\nwhich are also stable. The blood culture from the 4th of November came back negative, and your\n\nurine culture showed mixed growth.\n\nPatient:\n\nYes, I've been taking the prescribed medications, and things seemed to settle down after my ERCP\n\nback in September. My jaundice and itching have improved.\n\nDoctor:\n\nThat's good to hear. From your previous CT scan, it shows an infiltrative hyperechoic lesion in the\n\nright  hepatic  lobe.  The  largest  component  measures  7.5  cm,  with  bilobar  intrahepatic  biliary\n\ndilatation. There's also evidence of right portal vein angioinvasion, which is something we need to\n\n\fmonitor closely.\n\nPatient:\n\nI'm a little worried about the lesion, doctor. Does this mean the cancer has spread?\n\nDoctor:\n\nYes, there has been some progression, and the lesion is now invading the intrahepatic biliary ducts,\n\nwhich can affect bile flow. However, you're on sorafenib, which can help control the tumor growth.\n\nThe biliary stent we placed during the ERCP seems to be functioning well, and that's relieving some\n\nof the symptoms like jaundice.\n\nPatient:\n\nThat sounds reassuring. What else do we need to do?\n\nDoctor:\n\nWell continue the sorafenib treatment, as it has been effective. Additionally, I want you to follow up\n\nwith imaging in about 8 weeks, including fresh liver function tests. Ill also refer you for a review by\n\nthe interventional radiology team for possible loco-regional therapy options.\n\nPatient:\n\nWhat about the urinary symptoms? I've been having some discomfort in my right side, and I know\n\nthere's a stone in my right ureter.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYes,  the  CT  scan  from  November  showed  a  moderate  right  hydronephroureter  and  a  stone\n\nmeasuring  around  8.3  mm  in  the  distal  ureter.  Weve  already  planned  for  a  right  ureteric  stent\n\ninsertion, which is scheduled for this Friday, the 6th of December. After that, well keep monitoring\n\n\fyour kidney function and address any further issues.\n\nPatient:\n\nI see. I just want to make sure everything is managed properly.\n\nDoctor:\n\nAbsolutely, were monitoring your liver and kidney function closely. Ill also check in on your glucose\n\nlevels  as  you  mentioned  a  history  of  diabetes.  Even  though  you're  not  currently  on  medication  for\n\ndiabetes, we should make sure its under control.\n\nPatient:\n\nThanks, doctor. I feel more confident knowing you're keeping an eye on everything.\n\nDoctor:\n\nYou're  welcome.  I'll  see  you  again  for  your  follow-up  in  six  weeks,  but  if  you  have  any  concerns\n\nbefore then, don't hesitate to contact me. Well make sure you're getting the best care possible.\n\nFollow-up Plan:\n\nContinue Sorafenib 200mg twice daily.\n\nRefer to IR (Interventional Radiology) for assessment in loco-regional therapy options.\n\nFollow up in 6 weeks with updated liver function tests (LFTs).\n\nCT KUB to monitor the condition of the right ureteric stone and hydronephrosis.\n\n\fRight URS + JJ stent scheduled for 06/12/2024.\n\nContinue monitoring blood sugar levels and other systemic issues.\n\nPrevious Visits:\n\n26th  August  2024:  Your  liver  function  tests  showed  slightly  elevated  bilirubin  (11.8)  and  stable\n\nALT/AST levels. We planned an HRCT chest and additional tests, along with maintaining the Urso\n\n250mg and Ciprofloxacin 250mg.\n\n2nd September 2024: Referred for ERCP to address biliary issues.\n\n1st October 2024: Follow-up visit with urology for planning a right URS + JJ stent.\n\n5th  November  2024:  Seen  by  Dr.  Ahmad  Karim  Malik  for  intermittent  fevers  and  abdominal  pain,\n\npost-ERCP. The liver function improved after the procedure. We're proceeding with right URS + JJ\n\nstent next week.\n\n\f",
